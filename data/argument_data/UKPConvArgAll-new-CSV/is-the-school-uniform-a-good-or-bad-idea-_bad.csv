One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others.

arg199550_arg238471	goldLabel	a2	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.	I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.

One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.	people cant be forced to wear school uniforms, i mean each person has theri own wish whether they want to or dont want to wear school uniforms.
