Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.

OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else.

We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle.

Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join.
