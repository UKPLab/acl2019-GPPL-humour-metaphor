The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata.

"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument." True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.

That's interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory. It seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.

I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?	Evolution is as likely as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.
