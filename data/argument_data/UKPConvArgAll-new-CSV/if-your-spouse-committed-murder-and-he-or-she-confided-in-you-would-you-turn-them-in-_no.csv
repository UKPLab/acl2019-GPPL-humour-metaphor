People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.
arg33252_arg33328	goldLabel	a1	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again.

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,' I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??

If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.

No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership. Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,' I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY?? If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)

They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
