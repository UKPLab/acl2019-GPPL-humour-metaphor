Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)

477_390	goldLabel	a2	From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?	firefox is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
