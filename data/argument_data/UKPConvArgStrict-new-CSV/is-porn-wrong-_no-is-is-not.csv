I am a female who watches porn. It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. I think its natural for people to have sexual desires. If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it. But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.

Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.	The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government?
