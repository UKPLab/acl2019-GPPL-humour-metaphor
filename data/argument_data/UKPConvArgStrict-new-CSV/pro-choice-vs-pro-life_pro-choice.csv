I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being.

28841_1665	goldLabel	a1	a common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?" there is a simple counter to this: what if this person who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.	I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know: if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion? i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side
1700_46240	goldLabel	a2	Sorry, one more thing: I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against. If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.	Abortion is ok because a fetus isn't a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) You must be human (homosapien) You must be able to contribute to society. By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.
1698_1637	goldLabel	a2	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
37929_46240	goldLabel	a1	Im going to take the Obama approach to this Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it	Abortion is ok because a fetus isn't a human.

69016_1633	goldLabel	a2	Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.
1654_74039	goldLabel	a1	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.	You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.

It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
1661_1674	goldLabel	a1	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?

Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude.
71522_1662	goldLabel	a1	it's the woman's choice. you cannot control her. (anyway how do u know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need to have to illegaly abort a child and kill themselves at the same time.
73708_74039	goldLabel	a2	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.

The right to abortion should not be abused, however I do believe that the choice should be provided. NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.

1641_28415	goldLabel	a2	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.

Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
