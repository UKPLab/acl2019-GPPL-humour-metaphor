But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.	How are we supposed to curb childhood obesity if we don't start at a young age?

They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around.

PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult.

If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!	Because real PE lessons provide chances to people to realize on what they are capable of doing,so it will strengthen the self-esteem leading to them being productive in their society.

It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life.

If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.

If in every school of the world PE classes would be obligatory there would be much less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.

Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.
