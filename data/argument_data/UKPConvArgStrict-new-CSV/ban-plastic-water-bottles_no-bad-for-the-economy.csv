Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002. In 2001, for example globally bottled water companies produced over 130,000 million liters of water. This produced roughly 35,000 million dollars in revenue for the world's thousands of bottled water companies in 2001.	Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.

"In 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and in return promote healthier school choices for children. The articles illustrate the program and significant results thus far. Since its inception there has been a 58% cut in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Further, a survey was taken of parents, pediatricians and family physicians. The highest supported choice for each group was bottled water." (http://www.nikawater.org/bottled-water/ )
