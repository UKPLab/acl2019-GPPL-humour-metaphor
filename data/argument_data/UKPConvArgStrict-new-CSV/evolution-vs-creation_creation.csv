But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.
