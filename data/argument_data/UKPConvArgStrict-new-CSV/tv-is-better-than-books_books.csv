arg213472_arg315568	goldLabel	a1	books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a book if you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licence books can help you learn a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids so books are well better	While there are benifits to TV, i think books are better overal for learning as they require more focus.
arg135922_arg345719	goldLabel	a1	some ppl cant read is absolutely idiotic to say the ppl who cant read wud always run away frm dem bt even den B for books nd B for best so books r da best i cant sleep if i wont read a chapter frm any novel each day bt actually sometimes i feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks nd at home novels) so only sometimes i watch tv nd dat 2 news channels hence by reading books i can even pass my time nd even improve my speaking skills	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have terrible arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it TV rots the brain.
