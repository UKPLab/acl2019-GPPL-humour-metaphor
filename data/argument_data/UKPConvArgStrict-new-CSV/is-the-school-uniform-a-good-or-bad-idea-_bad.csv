The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.

One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.	I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable.

I think each principal should think once again regarding the uniforms

It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.	because your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want its coolio hoolio

On one hand, yes, uniforms help student focus more on thier work. On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school(kids are highly impressionable... etc.....). But kids are allowed ot have thier own creativity. Just like any other law or code, they can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things.

arg284049_arg238471	goldLabel	a1	students should wear what they like and feel free about their clothes	I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.

It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.

This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up.	i think we should not wear school cloths because their so weird and the good reason why is that no more bulling and also THERE DUMB STUPID AND GAY

arg200706_arg198954	goldLabel	a1	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.	I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.
