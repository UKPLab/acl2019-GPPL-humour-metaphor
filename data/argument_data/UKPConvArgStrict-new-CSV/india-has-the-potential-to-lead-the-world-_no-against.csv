Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.	i think, the india is not ready to lead the world because of many reasons.. 1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try to gain or earn money as possible. 2.) they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue .
