Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying. :)	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense.

806_62156	goldLabel	a1	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.	I just don't see why it matters so much. We're here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary. Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.

However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.

I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he? You clearly don't understand evolution. Read a book or two.	"So why don't we have talking monkeys?" That's a red herring. Monkeys haven't evolved to talk(by talk im guessing you mean speech) because they are incapable of speech. We on the other hand have evolved to talk.

The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense.

All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving.

The universe started out as a hot, dense space.

Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.	This is this common view of the creationist argument.

The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions.
