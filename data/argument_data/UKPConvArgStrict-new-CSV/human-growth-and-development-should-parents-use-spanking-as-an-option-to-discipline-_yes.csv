arg335090_arg335285	goldLabel	a1	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg335124_arg334886	goldLabel	a2	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
arg335285_arg334893	goldLabel	a2	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .
arg334967_arg335098	goldLabel	a2	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
arg336199_arg335054	goldLabel	a2	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
arg335092_arg336043	goldLabel	a2	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
arg334921_arg335134	goldLabel	a1	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works

arg334884_arg334967	goldLabel	a1	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
arg336563_arg335285	goldLabel	a1	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort

arg336176_arg334924	goldLabel	a2	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.

I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.

Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
arg335097_arg335047	goldLabel	a1	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.

It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
