There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?

How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D

Who needs em!)	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reason why i prefer Firefox.

The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)	Easly. I use Linux, and thanks to god, not existing an IE version to Linux! Firefox is open, you can do anything with that and no one will process you about that ;) oh yeah, and it's safe, cute, have addons, easy install, patches realeased in less time, etc, etc...

474_76359	goldLabel	a1	IE sucks and makes development harder, i just can't dig doing separate stylesheets for IE	Firefox of course. And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
26798_412	goldLabel	a2	the number of reasons on why ff ie are LISTLESS(:	That form of argument degrades this forum, and will cause the arguments to fall to the lowest common denominator. This word, "indisputable", I do not think it means what you think it does. I dispute your claim from personal experience, if nothing else. That makes it disputable. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more attuned to your style of debate. Check them out.
423_471	goldLabel	a2	The fact that the only reasonable argument IE users have is that they are cooler or get laid more only proves even more that firefox is better.	You are asked before anything is installed for the browser. In IE random toolbars appear from nowhere
472_389	goldLabel	a2	one feature that closed the deal is TABS... look what IE copied in version 7....	Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards while  soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards to keep their monopoly.
460_33757	goldLabel	a1	Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the net even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.	There's no reason at all why anyone could say IE is better. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
403_76359	goldLabel	a1	at least Firefox is not a copycat like internet explorer 7, who copied Firefox on the tabs.	Firefox of course. And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
486_73058	goldLabel	a1	Easly. I use Linux, and thanks to god, not existing an IE version to Linux! Firefox is open, you can do anything with that and no one will process you about that ;) oh yeah, and it's safe, cute, have addons, easy install, patches realeased in less time, etc, etc...	This is being argued? The only thing IE has going for it is that Windows has it pre-installed, and from what I've heard, they're going to get rid of that too. Everything from speed to add-ons, Firefox wins.

482_458	goldLabel	a2	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)	Mozilla Firefox can be used for everything! There are also plugins so that you can use the internet explorer engine in the firefox shell. It has many more plugins and the themes are a nice feature. all of the innovations in E 7.0 were in firefox years ago.
413_486	goldLabel	a1	Internet Explorer sucks extreme memory when running multiple tabs, and more than Firefox. And probably more; it could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances and use those as a blind.	Easly. I use Linux, and thanks to god, not existing an IE version to Linux!

469_394	goldLabel	a1	Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? It's not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.	i love firefox and defended it, but what is odd is that this site is breaking in it.
468_31493	goldLabel	a2	Firefox has the user made extensions which cater for the user based community therefore it wins	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/ OH AND. Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.

It remembers passwords with greater gusto. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
