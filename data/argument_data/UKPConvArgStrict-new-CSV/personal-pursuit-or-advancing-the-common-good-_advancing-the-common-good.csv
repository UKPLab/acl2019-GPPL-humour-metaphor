We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.

The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.

A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life.

When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.

Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.

When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run.

It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.

arg33135_arg33047	goldLabel	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.
arg33178_arg33110	goldLabel	a1	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor."

So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.

It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.

When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.

Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.

Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.

arg33178_arg33176	goldLabel	a1	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.

But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.

I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run.

Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help?

When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.

Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey (or) series of considerate acts one can have an less-difficult time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.

When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey (or) series of considerate acts one can have an less-difficult time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. The word for this debate is [sacrifice] How much would a person really "sacrifice" for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? No matter where a person is in thier life.... Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!

I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote.

So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people.

Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
arg33084_arg33099	goldLabel	a1	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.

Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.
arg33122_arg33061	goldLabel	a1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
arg33082_arg33141	goldLabel	a1	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
arg33110_arg33092	goldLabel	a2	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
arg33135_arg33061	goldLabel	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community.

arg33114_arg33131	goldLabel	a2	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.
arg33113_arg33178	goldLabel	a1	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.

In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever.

If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. Allot of people have succeded in doing so.

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.

When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.

Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.
arg33122_arg33099	goldLabel	a1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.

Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor."

arg33100_arg33177	goldLabel	a1	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.

Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
