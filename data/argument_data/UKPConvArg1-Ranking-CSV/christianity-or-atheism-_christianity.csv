arg243562	0.00833	If God doesn't exist, how come there are loads of predictions, sent by God, written thousands of years before Jesus saying exactly what happened to Jesus?
arg317490	0.01849	I have a personal relationship with Christ. I do believe.
arg434786	0.10558	I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home, grow a pair and ask yourself, why do I worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist.
arg236317	0.10461	This is just wrong we should not insult who we believe in we do not need to know what you people think
arg636360	0.00671	One of the key component to Christianity is FAITH. Just you because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith to Christians is the same way.
arg229317	0.00625	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
arg245838	0.12026	why are we fighting, right now those scientologists are running rampant. We need to come together to fight them
arg230311	0.00743	I found more peace in my belief and will continue to seek the Lord until the day I die.
arg231463	0.10102	I DON'T BELIEVE IN CHRISTIANITY NOR ATHEISM. I AM A MUSLIM, THATS THE BEST RELIGION...
arg244447	0.00830	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
arg229272	0.03749	Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. <br/> But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. <br/> Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?
arg229582	0.00804	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none... So if my religion has no proof so that gives your religion proof atheists? Makes no sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
arg254853	0.08411	all this debate proves is that the internet is full of conceded, stuck up, narcissistic, atheists who are totally bigoted and intolerant of other peoples beliefs and cant leave people alone to worship or not worship as they chose athieists are biggots plain and simple
arg229346	0.02034	I love Jesus, so I am on this side .
arg289787	0.01851	Christianity of course. Can't imagine life if I didn't believe in God. Actually I can, it would be hell.
arg237221	0.02132	Definitely Christianity :) and i am blessed to go to a christian school where i get to learn more about our amazing god :)
arg229291	0.04683	False Dichotomy. <br/> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/> I would also like to point that atheism predates Christianity, destroying your "test of time" argument (which was bullshit to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
arg247556	0.02075	Christianity, because I always root for the underdog. The membership of the atheist here is way bigger. Just look at the congregations of both.
arg231279	0.08386	Science attests to the existence of God, its only a question of which one at this point.
arg240139	0.02040	i am christian so i have to back up my religon and i also get to go to church.
arg236641	0.00690	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.
arg608928	0.00724	Well though I behave as an atheist certainly I don't forget the principles and norms of Christianity;As this argument has heated up,Its better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained that much ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
arg328209	0.01698	I am a Christian for I believe there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done here on earth.
arg238404	0.00902	You rather die believing in god,than not believing and finding out he exists!
arg644073	0.00646	Christianity does offer hope in the world. Christianity does tell others to help the poor.
arg234318	0.04394	God helps those who help themselves! So i will go and healp myself to school laptops then god will help me?
arg230910	0.01328	This is the most idiotic debate i have ever seen. HOW you tell me please hoe did we get so perfect were the earth and sun and moon is in the right spot and are bodys function perfectly are hands made distinctively. Cause we were made after his own image.
arg231008	0.02782	i'm not a Christianity but i mean if your a Christianity, you really can't argue with them at all unless your argument is base on on the same subject. kinda of like Street fighting and UFC. different platform.
arg296771	0.01299	I am neither Christian nor Atheist , but despite I beleive that Christianity is better than Atheism.If there is no place for God in your life , it can not even be callad as a "life".
arg244440	0.00673	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be. <br/> Although I'm religious person, I think atheist can stand to hear besause everyone is indepent and everyone has to have his own opinion.
