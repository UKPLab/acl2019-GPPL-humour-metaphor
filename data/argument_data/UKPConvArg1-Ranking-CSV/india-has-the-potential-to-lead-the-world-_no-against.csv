arg109565	0.00536	India will not lead the world because the gap between the rich and poor is too great and they still heavily believe in the caste system.

arg124182	0.00732	i strongly believe that India cannot lead . u people talk about the 7th , 3rd , 2nd rank of India in area defense and arable land respectively but here we r talking about the supreme power we cant rely on 2nd or 3rd. moreover the people r lazy they don't have the time 2 think about country's development they r happy at their home
arg128469	0.00636	First of, India does NOT have the potential to "rule" the world because have you seen the people? Good Indian people with good minds are in some foreign country getting a Nobel prize while the others are just stuck ups who don't do anything and push the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!
arg155750	0.06995	stupid india they actually really suck. so, BOO INDIA BOO!
arg206923	0.00976	this does not even make sense no one country should lead the world we all started together and thats the way it should end and everyone has there ways this is just not logical at all
arg133725	0.19627	i m student of class 11 .I have to take part in dbt. that' s why asked you,plz.give me more datas.i will be highly obliged to you
arg108959	0.00788	india is is good adopter but a bad developer and leader should be a great developer
arg123962	0.01363	Ha ha, no. <br/> India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, they cant even lead themselves.
arg125382	0.00693	with the cream layer quota system i don't prefer india to be leading the world in near future..... <br/> yes india have the potential.. but corruption , this quota system ( not helpful to anyone) , and the main reason brain drain , don't specialy help india in the matter....
arg118518	0.00498	India... where they have like a whole class of opressed people and a huge wealth differences? And with a language that the majority of the world can't understand and doesn't want to understand? India's education quality has nothing compared to Western education and it's the superpowers that control the world's economy. <br/> I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it doesn't even have the potential to. It should leave that to the superpowers.
arg106123	0.17750	Hahaha really? <br/> This debate is ridiculous. <br/> NO they don't. <br/> They're practically a 3rd world country.
arg126375	0.00484	well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first...so there's no question of leading the world so far....but still if we compare so lets have a look at the following points: <br/> 1. almost 90% of India is illiterate(don't be sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world.... <br/> 2.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development. <br/> 3.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself... <br/> So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"
arg127723	0.01177	I HAVE TO SAY BUT JUST 1 WORD: CORRUPTION, CORRUPTION & CORRUPTION........
arg118415	0.00649	As we know that India is fully filled with corruption. Each and every person have no time to help others, his only aim is to earn money in any way.Our manners and civilization are reducing and reducing every day.
arg145468	0.00469	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
arg123178	0.00828	i think with this growing condition Idia cannot replace other developed countries like USA LONDON AND other countries. <br/> Because most of the people are illitrate here so i think india cant.
arg129488	0.05417	Russell Peters is a master at making fun of these people.
arg207311	0.06138	nope last time i checked rags were for scrubbing toilets not fricken headgear. Whooo! USA
arg119997	0.00602	The increasing population means less land, and less land means a big crowd on every place. India is able to win gold medal of corrosion, terrorism , illeteracy, violence, etc.
arg106273	0.06052	India will never lead the world as long as no one can understand what they are saying with their freaking accent ;)
arg122478	0.00513	i think, the india is not ready to lead the world because of many reasons.. <br/> 1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try to gain or earn money as possible. <br/> 2.) they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue .
arg110540	0.05032	no way! screw off! China will dominate, if not, US will. india will never get the chance to ruin the world!
arg108968	0.05045	When the U.S. fought the Brits for their independence, the Brits wore a red uniform. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." <br/> If India ever tried to take over the U.S., Americans would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming." ;)
arg132199	0.00537	according to a recent report 50% scientists in NASA are indian IITians, just imagine that if those scientists will join ISRO then our status,value and astronomical knowledge of india will definetly increase. <br/> Now,think abt. IITians,students who are qualifying iit, they are known to be superbrain.If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why we are unable provide them a perfect job of their level.we are giving international status of education.then why unable to take best advantages from them.this is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment as well as proper salary.so its the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
arg217848	0.06091	Why should India lead the world???!!! <br/> Kill all the politicians first and India will be developed tomorrow.
arg105946	0.00635	Nah, they can't even organize their damned streets! They bathe in the same river in which they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges! They're extremely poor - they can't even manage their own budget, much less a planet! <br/> I'm going to get down-voted and insulted, but everything I have written is the truth.
arg133726	0.01121	syona if look at glance, then most of us are unable to specify any solid solutions by which we can remove the hurdle in our progress from root.we all are very much aware of problems but unable to give solutions.they are criticizing government,terrorism and so on.no one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty? <br/> everyone should understand abt. their importance and role for country.Because a good citizen,a criminal,terrorist,corrupted politician, everyone is human, then why a human is creating problem for another human.I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
arg118214	0.00613	i dont think soooo even as an indian citizen.........because of soo much unemployment i dont think the gdp of india will increase in the next 5 years....... they dont even have enough funds to feed all the poor..how can we even imagine them to lead the world...........
arg110562	0.00588	India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians ,numerous religion, fight between various religions, and a lot more............................
arg118660	0.00692	India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest man power n third largest army in the world n it is a country full of hopes n aspirations n for Indians nothing is impossible, n we r proud to be Indians n we will lead the world n be the king of the world in every manner. even 34% scientists in NASA are Indians.
