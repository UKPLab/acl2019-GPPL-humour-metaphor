1661	0.00746	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.
1636	0.00770	I am personally against the abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother what I think or what most of the people thinks about it. She must decide what to do with her child.
28841	0.00720	a common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?" <br/> there is a simple counter to this: <br/> what if this person who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
1700	0.14957	Sorry, one more thing: <br/> I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against. <br/> If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
28498	0.00809	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. <br/> And I know many children get adopted but many don't <br/> and it might be better off to just have an abortion to <br/> let them suffer. <br/> That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to <br/> decide one womans pregnancy.
1635	0.01988	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.
37929	0.00633	Im going to take the Obama approach to this <br/> Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it
1639	0.00730	It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of "who decides"? <br/> A woman is not your property. Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude.
74766	0.00777	The right to abortion should not be abused, <br/> however I do believe that the choice should be provided. <br/> NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.
1658	0.15027	Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted. Needless to say they should have let her.
71522	0.01771	it's the woman's choice. you cannot control her. (anyway how do u know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)
73708	0.00910	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
1660	0.15051	So then you're saying the if the woman were to get an abortion right after than t would be fine?
28415	0.00614	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? <br/> If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.
1644	0.15764	your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. <br/> You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
1674	0.01115	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
1640	0.00866	people can make the choice for themselves. it is not up to us or the government to decide to add more unwanted children to this world.
1633	0.00594	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.
43517	0.01684	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh? <br/> Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
58594	0.00773	It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
37093	0.06820	Ahora en mi querido idioma, lo diré <br/> Eso a lo que llaman un "bebé, un ser humano" no es más que una planta, menos, me atrevería a decir <br/> Lo único que hace es chupar recursos, al igual que la planta, aunque las plantas nos dan oxígeno... <br/> Nadie niega que sea una vida, pero no puede sentir ni pensar, que es lo que suelen decir que hace más a los humanos que a los animales <br/> El aborto es matar a un parásito
1662	0.01918	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need to have to illegaly abort a child and kill themselves at the same time.
69016	0.01372	Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
1634	0.00963	It really depends the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.
1683	0.02420	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
1654	0.00698	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
63512	0.00615	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
1637	0.00888	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. <br/> Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
1565373184	0.01651	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice ftw
46240	0.01064	Abortion is ok because a fetus isn't a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) <br/> You must be human (homosapien) <br/> You must be able to contribute to society. <br/> By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.
1641	0.01201	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.
74039	0.00689	You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.
1665	0.01274	I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know: <br/> if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion? <br/> i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side
1698	0.01353	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
1659	0.00773	A women and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why is that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty? <br/> Jon Jax 71
