arg334967	0.02793	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
arg336199	0.02940	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
arg335090	0.00501	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
arg335285	0.02331	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg334884	0.00466	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.
arg334932	0.00635	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
arg334886	0.00494	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
arg335124	0.01692	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.
arg334893	0.00903	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .
arg335098	0.00617	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
arg335054	0.00533	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
arg336043	0.00499	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
arg335092	0.02696	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
arg336176	0.21869	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
arg334938	0.00594	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.
arg334921	0.00571	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.
arg335134	0.00859	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works
arg334964	0.00590	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.
arg335089	0.19764	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again
arg336563	0.00647	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
arg334919	0.01704	spanking can be sometimes good for the child to understand but not to the point where you can hurt and should not be used repeatedly
arg335097	0.00452	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
arg334922	0.01959	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
arg336222	0.00488	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)
arg335034	0.19250	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.
arg335047	0.00475	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
arg336171	0.01041	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
arg334973	0.02739	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.
arg334959	0.00469	yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad
arg334972	0.00855	I believe some parents should spank their kids but only when nessasary because sometimes thats the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.
arg334898	0.00883	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
arg334924	0.01618	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.
arg334923	0.00534	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!
arg334920	0.03370	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
arg335094	0.02169	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.
