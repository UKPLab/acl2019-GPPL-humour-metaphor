12414	0.00558	I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". <br/> And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.

70614	0.00548	Two men/women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?
12399	0.12889	for the record - I am not gay. I'm married and have a little daughter.
12433	0.00509	"This idea is essentially playing with semantics." <br/> I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." <br/> "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." <br/> This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? <br/> "...why challenge any assumption?" <br/> I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.
12441	0.01887	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? <br/> Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?
65364	0.00608	Marriage evolved because of moral and religious grounds rather than a mere union approved by the state... To debase marriage just to accomodate base desires of gay couples in disguise if a right is simply stupid...
73436	0.00489	Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. (Lord of the Flies)
32066	0.01055	there is no such thing as "gay marriage". Marriage can only be between a man and a woman.
12402	0.00504	From a religious standpoint gay marriage isn't even possible. Let along right. But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. <br/> Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.
31527	0.00457	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.
12469	0.01503	Gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.
12413	0.13207	Why are you arguing about a U.S. decision when you are in Canada?
69708	0.09900	Of course its wrong. <br/> Why do you think Aids exists?
12417	0.00844	Gay people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
76357	0.12743	HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG!!!! And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
265924403	0.00898	Basing the bible it's definitely wrong and realistically marriage is intended for man and a woman it's one way of saying to reproduce.
80501	0.00970	To me gay marriage is wrong. I respect other opinions but to me it is an unnatural way and against my moral law.
12431	0.00459	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. <br/> A law requiring separate schools and public accomodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.
12421	0.00429	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. <br/> It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. <br/> Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
1890830085	0.00646	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
12449	0.15494	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it looks like chasbas' argument which I rebutted on Feb 07, 2007 07:09 has been deleted, presumably by chasbas. I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
48935	0.00524	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. This idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
12440	0.01985	Here is a reason why gay marriage could be wrong. If gay marriage is ok, then sister and brother marriage is ok too? Whats the difference? Oh wait, the sex is the difference, so SISTER and SISTER or BROTHER and BROTHER is ok... right?
72397	0.00701	I am a christian. The bible says plain out that homosexuality is wrong. Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the bible is the TRUTH, the WHOLE truth, and the ONLY truth.
70817	0.00806	Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases gay marrage has caused so much trouble pepole has resulted in murder and sucied
12460	0.00499	Guys AND Girls were made for a reason. This reason is not so they can pair up with the same sex. It is so that they can pair up with opposite genders. Opposites Attract, Every where, wether its in magnets, electricity, atoms, or humans. Besides, it just doesnt work with two guys (genitals), thats why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.. Guy AND Girl!
12466	0.01023	gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). <br/> if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
12447	0.00471	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well. It's not only about love.
76796	0.00446	Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. <br/> I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
12409	0.01239	"Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In which <br/> case gay marriage may help reduce the problem. " <br/> What is 'gay sex'? <br/> I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the person was attempting to make was that UNPROTECTED ANAL sex can increase the liklihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true. But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
42624	0.00445	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? <br/> If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. <br/> Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. <br/> You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
69699	0.00870	its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
30502	0.00661	I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.
12430	0.00793	If being homosexual was natural then <br/> 1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around....heck I wouldn't be around <br/> 2. If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. <br/> Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.
