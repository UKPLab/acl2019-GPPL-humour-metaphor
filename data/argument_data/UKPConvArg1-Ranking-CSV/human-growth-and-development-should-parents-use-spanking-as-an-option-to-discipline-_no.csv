arg334934	0.00768	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
arg335091	0.04001	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
arg334961	0.01325	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.
arg335032	0.02141	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. <br/> Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
arg336204	0.00745	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.
arg334958	0.01557	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
arg335030	0.01299	Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
arg334943	0.00745	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
arg334927	0.12208	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals lol I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
arg335095	0.00846	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
arg335086	0.04937	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
arg334918	0.02241	Because if the child is young they dont know whats wrong and whats right the parent needs to teach the child from whats wrong and from whats right
arg334978	0.04349	I don't think that spanking should be necessary,spanking would last just a minute, but punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.
arg335096	0.04158	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
arg335564	0.00753	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them
arg335084	0.01295	I think parents should not spank because there's other way to make them behave.
arg336894	0.00829	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
arg336209	0.19398	No because if we hit our children their gonna think that we don't love them.
arg335112	0.01407	Honestly, I Think It's better to try a different option besides spanking that can affect a child's way of thinking and may get depressed
arg335104	0.02788	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done like if some one else made thm mad thy let it all out on thm
arg334891	0.01282	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
arg335129	0.12456	I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option
arg336048	0.00874	People should not hit there kids because the kid will think it is OK to hit someone else back like for an example at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.
arg336179	0.00817	No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.
arg336172	0.02169	Not everything begins with violence, parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if its necessary .
arg335114	0.04497	There's some parents that spank their children for every little thing. And that is not right. They will always be scared of them.
arg334926	0.01532	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child.
arg334929	0.00840	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.
arg335132	0.00981	I disagree on the parents use spaking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens
arg334968	0.01007	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.
arg334907	0.00900	Spanking children will bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children . It is not make sense.
arg334960	0.01238	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.
arg334975	0.00942	no, spanking is not the solution to your problems... <br/> u should talk to the kid with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong..
arg334890	0.01537	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.
arg336029	0.01137	does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody then you get hit. you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the saame person
