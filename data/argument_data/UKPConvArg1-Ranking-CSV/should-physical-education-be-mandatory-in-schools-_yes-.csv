arg345997	0.00789	I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
arg110326	0.12321	if physical educations r not ter then u wud b a couch potato <br/> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!howzz tat???
arg230691	0.00748	schools should have PE because the school i attend only has pe for middle school not high school we are a middle and a high school combined. because the lack of physical education in our high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple" the lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish only 3 push-ups!
arg251946	0.14737	of cz phys ed must be taught but mustn"t b compulsory coz sme of us are not fit 2 du the extensive exersises perfomed
arg251944	0.08173	physical education is a waste of time and therefore should not be studied in schools
arg107456	0.00733	Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.
arg213068	0.02202	How are we supposed to curb childhood obesity if we don't start at a young age?
arg34837	0.01442	thats so stupid. physical education teaches kids that it dosent matter if your a nerd or a jock because if theyre all in the same class doing the same thing then theyre all the same in the aspect that they only pass that class if they put forth effort. and from personal expirence sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside
arg7751	0.00764	It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life. Plus, there's the benefit of working together as a team that doesn't always happen in other classes.
arg260899	0.00886	Yes. Physical education, if taught and encouraged properly and approached with the right attitude, will be rewarding for both student and teacher.
arg96685	0.11707	You are 100% right because I am in Pe and they make us wear these stupid outfits. I think they make us wear those so the Gay coaches can see our private parts. and PE is just Stupid
arg7765	0.00901	Yes of course. Apart from the health benefits, there's the greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation to name but a few. Now drop and give me twenty for your insolence!
arg552867	0.00866	Yes, because... <br/> 1st, It's a fun activity of the school day, that we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our excerse-- lose the weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but... <br/> 2nd, Obesity is certainly a proble in the U.S., so it would help! <br/> 3rd, People can have a moment that they'll eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat!...................................... <br/> I'm Done!!... Now go get a life, and lose some weight!!!!
arg244438	0.02370	YES, because some children don't understand anything expect physical education especially rich children of rich parents.
arg204909	0.01112	The answer is so obvious. Teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their mussels and get thinner and more flexible instead of fatter and more lazy so they won't get bullied as much.
arg316344	0.00786	This will help kids learn good qualities like leadership and discipline. This could also lead to help childhood obesity. It is just the fact that kids are not pushed in their homes to have any physical activity.
arg202285	0.01056	physical education should be mandatory cuhz 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 so far and it's because of the lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese!!!!
arg71112	0.02295	Definattley all those obese kids need excersise and its a whloe part of life of course it should be mandortory.
arg54258	0.00731	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.
arg107445	0.02058	i think that PE clases should be obligatory in school to help the problem of obecity.
arg37974	0.11337	Kids are fat these days.. p.e. helps!!1!!!!!one!!!! <br/> and itll help them relize heath is important for there lame ass futures lol
arg107450	0.00872	In my opinion I think that it should be obligatory to have PE classes in schools because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes would be obligatory there would be much less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
arg406468	0.11207	people are just sitting on there asses all day playing video games when they need there fucking exercise. So fat people go out side and play football or something and people that are not fat stop playing video games and go and get your energy back and these are my words "peace out assholes
arg220374	0.01598	I think it definatley should be manditory. when you look on to the streets at kids playing they are most likley over weight because they eat to much and dont get enough physical exercise.
arg207833	0.01542	i think we should have gym because kids get FAT and tubby! its not ok for kids to get fat and tubby!!!!!
arg135251	0.00886	I agree with everything said her because children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.
arg287979	0.02060	yes! our kids are so out of shape for the most part and eat too much junk
arg46577	0.00956	Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes. <br/> Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. <br/> Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. <br/> Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. <br/> Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s)
arg217790	0.01061	because today lots of students are playing computer games when the school finish. and than students can't get good health and also students can get serious dieases like cancer because of electromagnetic waves. this is true because computer have lots of electromagnetic waves.
arg148559	0.00756	I think it is great idea to make physical education be mandatory in school because it will be healthy for the student to become a healthy person and they will not have the risk of obesity.
arg247696	0.01048	Because real PE lessons provide chances to people to realize on what they are capable of doing,so it will strengthen the self-esteem leading to them being productive in their society.
