When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.
12565	0.07757	k, I believe that 'God' created and then tweaked via evolution? <br/> we all find out within 100 years anyways....
80918	0.08368	you cannot argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extreamly dumb argument because anybody who beleives in creatoinism who is arguing with anyone who doesn't can say that god makes them think what they think <br/> TAKE A HINT EVERYBODY THIS ARGUMENT IS MORONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12567	0.00597	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
12568	0.00659	God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. <br/> Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to get your hands around. <br/> It's funny that the supposedly unsophisticated ancients would all choose to believe in an abstract concept rather than a concrete one. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?
12592	0.05107	I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history
28068	0.00614	"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument." <br/> True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.
12586	0.01052	Then according to your theory the fruit flies would have adapted and survived <br/> So I'm not really sure how that argument works...
68938	0.01031	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
12595	0.00872	Believing "Evolution" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of stuck together.
12588	0.00826	That's interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. <br/> I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... <br/> Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory. It seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.
12581	0.07785	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger
39335	0.06637	1. why is creation not science? <br/> 2. why is this classified under the religion category? <br/> 3. you disillusioned ppl think you look like monkeys?
12582	0.07056	Was there a historical record of man evolving? <br/> dang, I must have missed it
12583	0.06643	You're just as much brainwashed as I am <br/> except you're the other side
70855	0.00612	There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
12563	0.04681	Oops, I meant to say creationist version of evolution. My apologies.
12579	0.00755	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history <br/> With the writing of the Old Testament <br/> I think you are referring to a time of more recent Christianity <br/> So the Biblical account is an argument which has been in existance much longer than your note
44125	0.00883	Our world could be a giant hologram <br/> http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html <br/> It is exceedingly likely that we live in a simulated universe
44218	0.05425	it shouldnt be about how we got here but why are we here.
12585	0.00926	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument <br/> I'm very familiar with it <br/> I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process <br/> Both moth colors have always been there <br/> Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution- <br/> That's a diet plan
12575	0.00938	For us to understand God, is like your cat or dog trying to understand your income tax report! <br/> Evolution and Creation go hand in hand!
12573	0.06042	* <br/> If evolution is true.... <br/> How come people aren't still evolving?
70818	0.07545	If evealution is real find me someone/something that is half way
12591	0.04703	Actually you must know nothing about debate because what I am doing is called <br/> "Cross Examining" <br/> and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position <br/> Also, Calling names never won a debate <br/> You just can't answer my questions and I'm sure that is frustrating for you
12587	0.00716	What I meant was that in the situation, both moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were on the trees to begin with... <br/> "Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution." <br/> -Who selects this mutation to occur? Does it just happen by good fortune?
12580	0.00651	That's your best argument - "Because they don't" ? <br/> I thought there was a reason for everything... <br/> I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. <br/> How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? <br/> And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties" <br/> I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change <br/> And by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person... <br/> what insects are you talking about?
68913	0.00694	In the 21'st century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. Creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on mankind.
12589	0.00576	That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't? <br/> Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? <br/> I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today? <br/> Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? <br/> What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
844698385	0.01320	Evolution is as likely as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.
57300	0.01175	now tell me this evolution beleivers... how is it that evolution is true, and man kind is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you whom HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in arabic makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of adam...
67586	0.00765	although i voted for evolution... creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
12577	0.05995	Why do you assume that god needs to operate within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time? :)
