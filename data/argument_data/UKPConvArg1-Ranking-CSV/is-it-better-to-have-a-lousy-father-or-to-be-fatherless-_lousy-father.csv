arg35726	0.00835	It would be better to have a lousy father than to not a have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.
arg35647	0.01483	I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I'm doing just fine. <br/> I just think thats it better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him, or what he looks like would ( to me ) be a insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to know he exist would be better to me.
arg35664	0.01071	Fathers can sometimes be lousy, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.
arg35750	0.04767	I say lousy, if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. <br/> However, if pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
arg35609	0.03249	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
arg35693	0.01242	I Believe that its better to have a lously father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a lously father would mean you cant prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.
arg35700	0.02899	I would have to choose a lousy father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for you or the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps thing stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty lousy but he does support me and helps out sometimes I would rather have a father than none.
arg35720	0.12782	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
arg35615	0.01046	Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy they are still our kin.
arg35759	0.00993	Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.
arg35650	0.00821	I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.
arg35635	0.00868	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
arg35666	0.02564	I would have to pick having a lousy father than not having a father at all because, there will be a point where you may need his help. (It may not help but at least you tried.) I know that I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
arg35716	0.00906	To have a father is better than to not have one at all. I know that a lousy father is very bad to have and he probaly wont do all the things that a good father would do, but at least yo have that assurance that you have someone that is a father in your life. I beileve that people can change. You can never feel the same way about somebody for your whole life. There will come a time in his life that he will realize that he needs to be there for you. You have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.
arg35655	0.17744	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.
arg35636	0.03370	I think it's better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because, growing up without a father can be hard for some kids. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong, but as long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have somebody their to support your decisions and encourage you.
arg35642	0.14028	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesnt think I need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
arg35688	0.01164	Having a Lousy father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a Lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.
arg35643	0.01165	A lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.
arg35751	0.02985	It is better to have a lousy father because; when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector. <br/> Almost every father is lousy, because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father thinking that they had a father, in any shape or form.
arg35714	0.01431	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
arg35629	0.02503	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
arg35585	0.01239	I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
arg35584	0.00821	It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
arg35640	0.02998	I think is better to have a lousy father than a fatherless because you can count on your father. No matter what your father is always going to be there for you in the good and bad times. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father than you don't have nobody to count with or tell him your problems.
arg35619	0.00769	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. <br/> So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way) <br/> Also, people change. Who says that he will be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.
arg35623	0.01202	I believe its better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless. I myself know what's its like to not have a father, so to me it would be better to have a lousy father than no father at all. For some people, to have a lousy father is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you really have it until he is gone and never coming back.
arg35732	0.00912	I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was.

arg35638	0.02727	I rather have a lousy father then not have a father at all. Having a lousy father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if he's lousy you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
arg35746	0.01375	To my knowledge people are able to change and make themselves better people. I would much rather have the hope that my father could be a good father, than know that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could of been.
arg35697	0.02455	I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.

arg35747	0.01463	I feel like it's better to have a lousy father than to not have one at all.

So to have a lousy father would be better.
arg35698	0.02064	Its better to have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better". Even if you have a lousy father his going to love you no matter what.
arg35676	0.01142	I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
