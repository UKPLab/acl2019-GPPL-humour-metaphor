arg168835	0.00903	Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
arg168784	0.01674	Raffles was followed by Farquhar during his visit to Singapore.This shows that Raffles saw Singapore before Farquhar making him the founder
arg168828	0.02233	Raffles had written his discovery wrongly as 29 February 1819.It was later corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his firs journey
arg168787	0.18295	IF YOU go live in that olden time conditions in just one month in those conditions it would be a surprise if you did not catch a disease every single day.hospitals was one thing raffles built and that would have saved so many people in those times because the living there was conditions were bad. another reason he has helped on the development
arg580842	0.01402	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it will be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern and he worked towards it. And while Raffles was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly causing Raffles to feel dissappointed.
arg167721	0.00795	It was undoubtedly Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
arg168833	0.17318	HE HAS A BOSS(RAFFLES) HE HAS TO FOLLOW HIM AND NOT GO ABOUT DOING ANYTHING ELSE IF THEN WHY CANT FARQUHAR HELP SINGAPORE AFTER HE WAS FIRED!!! I SAID HE DOES NOT HAVE THE POSITION TO BE THE FOUNDER!!!! <br/> Farquhar has a boss!(raffles) he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if then why cant farquhar help singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, effort is all invested. You must know people who would help you.
arg168826	0.00996	Raffles was the one who stopped Singapore from being taken by the Dutch, as the Dutch were upset that Singapore would be taken by the British. but Raffles stop the Dutch from taking Singapore. If it had not been for Raffles, the Dutch would have taken Singapore.
arg168781	0.02163	When Raffles came back after a period of time, he changed rules and concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs. This can show that he cares for the people.
arg168769	0.03550	The Singapore Treaty is signed between Raffles,Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with Commandant under the accompanying seven ships witnessing the event.
arg168795	0.00749	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singapore support of the British. If William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder because he did the "grunt work", shouldn't the supervisor of a construction site get the most commission, instead of the contractor? And besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of free will
arg168798	0.00951	Sir Raffles is the rightful founder because ,he increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
arg168824	0.00750	Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that William Farquhar was the one that remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen, also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's Development, so he should be considered a founder.

arg168772	0.05778	Before leaving Singapore, Raffles did leave some plans and policies that were important for the development of the settlement.
arg168765	0.01105	well the definition of founder discussed in class that day that founder was not the person who discovers the place but he is the key in the development of the place and raffles came to singapore and established it on a global level...although it may have been farquhar who suggest this to raffles
arg168815	0.00914	To be able to have a succeful trading port you must have good contacts with many people and raffles had those contacts without him we would not have a trading port at all! I would like to mention that raffles had all the important qualities of a founder and he was in good position to do so. He invested a lot and we therefore credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform WHY because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest money time and effort in such a project.
arg551859	0.02091	No.If you research about FarQuhar.He didn't do anything to help Singapore while Raffles was away,instead of doing anything he just made a big mess and allowed things like vice,crimes and gambling dens carry on.

arg168794	0.02153	It was Raffles who signed the treaty with the Sultan Hussein,not Farquhar. Farquhar was just Raffles subordinate.
arg168800	0.01243	Some would say that raffles left singapore for a few years and left farquer incharge therefore he negleted us. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care OF THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting singapore? He has a life!

arg168775	0.01527	It was Raffles that led the expedition in order to find a new trading port. Farquhar only tagged along with Raffles. So even if Farquhar did not come Raffles would have still founded Singapore.
arg168790	0.01148	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
arg168821	0.01201	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart
arg168809	0.02198	Raffles found that Farquhar had done a bad job of raising the city of Singapore, he also introduced opium selling into Singapore in order to raise more money to build Singapore.
arg168810	0.01049	Raffles established local magistrate in Singapore.This local magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery to be controlled Farquar protected Singapore from the Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
arg580839	0.01086	Raffles was the boss of farquhar and thus should be the founder of Singapore sine he was the leader and had more rights than farquhar. In addition, farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibilily and allowed slaves, cockfighting and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.

arg168789	0.03134	Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate for Raffles. So it was normal that Raffles gave he duty of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar to handle.
arg168778	0.00751	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"
