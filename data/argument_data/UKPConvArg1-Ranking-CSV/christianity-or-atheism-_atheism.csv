arg229241	0.00469	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
arg240625	0.03174	christians are also fun to lawl at because they waste half of their sunday going to church. What a waste!!!! HAHAHA
arg439197	0.00536	I'm sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spamming. I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
arg488149	0.00703	I am an atheist because i believe that we all have one life that we should enjoy and preserve for all future generations
arg231494	0.00625	we have scientific evidence that the flood of noah could not have happened. THINK ABOUT THIS : IF THE FLOOD OF NOAH HAPPENED, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND THE REMAINS OF LONG DEAD ANIMALS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WE DO NOT FIND THIS AT ALL. DINOSAUR BONES ARE FOUND IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LAYERS OF ROCK STRATA, AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS. IF THE FLOOD HAD HAPPENED, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND DINOSAURS AND ALL OTHERE REMAINS IN THE SAME LAYER OF ROCK BUT WE DONT.
arg230365	0.00979	I'd like to point out how few disputs there are on the Christian side, that's cuz free minded people dont need to convince other's. We know that there isn't a god, and that its up to us to make our lives.
arg229388	0.00782	I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) <br/> I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. <br/> It allows for more logic in my mind.
arg244579	0.00613	Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.
arg229398	0.00781	Notmymuse, <br/> Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. <br/> I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary. <br/> Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). <br/> Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity. <br/> Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. <br/> - <br/> Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.
arg270902	0.00484	Religion in the past has caused many wars. It encourages racism , sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. the time has come to put a stop to it.
arg328210	0.00585	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the qualifying factor, I'm going with Atheism. God isn't Christian.
arg240623	0.01294	there is no god. Science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up so people from simplier times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
arg246334	0.00504	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. <br/> With Athe√Øsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
arg250846	0.01899	Atheism; I need at least some evidence before I can believe in magic.
arg231497	0.03861	INTELLIGENT DESIGN THEORY IS MERELY CHRISTIANITY MASQUERADING AS SCIENCE, BUT THERE IS NO REAL SCIENCE BEHIND INTELLIGENT DESIGN.
arg613494	0.00695	No one has ever waged a war in the name of atheism.
arg230146	0.03643	Eh, Atheism is a pretty cool guy. Makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.
arg231485	0.04034	ever since recorded history weve believed in sky spirits for which no evidence exists at all.
arg575745	0.00501	No one ever said science is PERFECT. That's the difference between Religion and Science, Science admits it doesn't have all the answers while Religion is SO dogmatic enough to not even recognise FACTS. And even just what TRUTH really stands for.
arg231491	0.00677	religious people are always using the same argument: you cant prove he doesn't exist!!!!you CANNOT disprove a negative. meaning, you cant prove something is not there,which already is not there.
arg229697	0.28174	Why do you think we can't stand that question? <br/> ALso you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism one and on
arg229265	0.00869	Christianity is perhaps the most vile ideal to poison the minds of men. It's uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral. <br/> (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html) <br/> (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/whynotchristian.html) <br/> (http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/ 3956.Christopher_Hitchens)
arg231620	0.04044	For reasons that should be totally obvious, and which I would assume have been thoroughly fleshed out by others involved.
arg244514	0.03728	It is ignorant and idiotic to think that god exist. Any other argument is completely invalid.
arg488146	0.00876	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc <br/> Atheism: the rejection of these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense
arg237637	0.05004	god aint flipppin real, so get over it u dumb belivers of god
arg254062	0.00543	The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser. <br/> What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations. <br/> There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
arg250867	0.24888	If god loves everyone then y does he hate gays and the bible is just a book, have you ever wondered that the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good
arg231487	0.00556	this is my big problem with christianity: why is it about belief. there have been horrible people who are believers. what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature od reality is??? I AM an atheist and im a good person. the idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is beyond preposterous, its madness!!
arg229484	0.00613	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of god, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not.
arg253486	0.00929	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are christian or atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or other"?
arg488148	0.02939	Did i also mention that christianity condones slavery? If jot I'm sorry
