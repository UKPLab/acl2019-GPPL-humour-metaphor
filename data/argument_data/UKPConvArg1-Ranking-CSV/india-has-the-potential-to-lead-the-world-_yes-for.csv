arg623493	0.00678	I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime) India will excel. <br/> India has the potential.
arg123811	0.03458	ndians has always been powerful why r u forgeting about its ancient glory history
arg106108	0.00737	Of course it has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. I can't think of a leading nation that has had large scale internal conflict, it just doesn't work. To "lead" a country must have time and resources to worry about other countries and not itself.
arg119309	0.05029	India is a good country to live in... <br/> it has diverse culture but still it unites as one. <br/> Saare jagah se achcha... <br/> Hindustan hamara...
arg116888	0.00660	Yes. India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur , while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.

arg126378	0.00628	The Indian economy is galloping at a breakneck speed and might even reach double-digit growth by 2013, feel Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a long time to come. <br/> The India growth story is indeed enviable. Despite being plagued by myriad problems, India has emerged stronger and more resilient to any global crises so far. <br/> India is expected to be the world's fastest growing economy by 2018, according to Economist Intelligence Unit, a research arm of the Economist magazine.
