arg198954	0.00452	I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.
arg236737	0.00897	I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniform OK
arg251309	0.00429	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
arg203444	0.17212	Their gay! Actually this is just experience... I'm not gay but all the kids that are at my h-school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms
arg352482	0.00794	Students should be allowed to express them selves.. and with the uniform .. well they are all the same... thats boring.
arg199549	0.00466	Another reason argued against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.
arg233332	0.00492	Only in private schools and even there I would only agree with it because its a voluntary association. You see I think school uniforms supress free speech, and take away from a youth's individuality.
arg252467	0.00852	i dont think its a good idea to keep restrictions becoz thats just going to make students especialy teens more hungry for fashion .its better 2 feed them than keeping them hungry.and once they r away from these restrictions,we will c d othr side of them which is way worse with no morals.so alow people 2 b free with their personalities instead of stoping them.
arg198939	0.00533	The last thing which a school ought to do is attempt to hinder the creative expression - the individuality - of their still-developing children.
arg231770	0.03847	i thik thier bad because i think ushould be free with out nobody telling u wat to do
arg238471	0.00551	I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
arg205531	0.00612	uniform sucks. wearing uniform doesn't mean better learning at school (students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to waste money to buy uniform ).. NO CONNECTION BETWEEN UNIFORM WORN N SCHOOL RESULTS...
arg198926	0.00603	When there young and trying to find them selves there is no need to get rid of there independence. I vote bad
arg386882	0.17110	Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
arg200706	0.00452	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.
arg339127	0.00694	people cant be forced to wear school uniforms, i mean each person has theri own wish whether they want to or dont want to wear school uniforms. I think each principal should think once again regarding the uniforms
arg251373	0.00481	Schools should not create dress codes. <br/> On one hand, yes, uniforms help student focus more on thier work. On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school(kids are highly impressionable... etc.....). But kids are allowed ot have thier own creativity. <br/> Just like any other law or code, they can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things.
arg287477	0.00899	it dose not show kids expressions and unforms dose not show is it
arg554188	0.08511	School uniforms are a BAD idea. Kids won't be able to show their color.
arg284049	0.00743	students should wear what they like and feel free about their clothes
arg199159	0.00466	I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
arg238473	0.00739	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
arg203931	0.03316	Very Very bad!! <br/> Though I Know im going to miss the days to wear a uniform!! <br/> So When IN a student I hate wearing uniforms <br/> And <br/> When Im a college student I MISS wearing their Uniform!!:d
arg198306	0.00622	School uniform cant save person out of cold or heat like special clothes.
arg199550	0.00629	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
arg198296	0.01748	It is in not comfortable when you sit for an hours in a classroom.
arg202425	0.01332	Kids don't want to wear the same clothes every day I know I would hate it.
arg238468	0.01078	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up.
arg580099	0.00827	Students have the right way to feel and express but it's wrong it's the learning which makes us smart
arg202290	0.00541	in my own personal opinion i think that school uniforms are not a good idea. adults are always telling us to be our selfes and to express who we really are. but we cant do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!!
arg237112	0.03440	because your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want its coolio hoolio
arg336277	0.00785	the kids lose their individuality and it doesn't feel comfortable
arg251644	0.00855	When yr out of college or High School or whatever, like in a office. You have to choose yr own clothing.
arg207279	0.26045	i think we should not wear school cloths because their so weird and the good reason why is that no more bulling and also THERE DUMB STUPID AND GAY
arg283557	0.00949	I think that school uniform is a bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and its a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the mmorning
