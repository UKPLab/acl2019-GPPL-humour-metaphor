33187	0.00657	Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cuz I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
12372	0.01073	if the firefox is the best then why everybody tries to have IE compatible sites?
12383	0.00581	I used to be a firefox user but I only have 2GBs of RAM on my system and I like to use more than one program at a time. Firefox sucks up way too much memory to justify the one or two advantages.
12370	0.01350	Spam and adware seems to be so much more compatible with IE.
67088	0.00909	IE was there since then and is already installed in a typical computer. IE is UNIVERSAL! Firefox still needs to be downloaded or installed.
12373	0.19010	You go to school with me and you are 14 years old lol.
12371	0.00608	I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. <br/> So I think IE is better than firefox.
50377	0.18892	hey nobrob wasnt ie invented before firefox ah derrrr !!!!!!!!
12374	0.02057	IE is scum, stole the idea of tabbed browsing from all the other browsers, and you can't get extensions for it.
12367	0.00629	Firefox (and the extensions) leaks memory like a sieve. An opened session of Firefox 2.0.0.1, three tabs, one week, uses 250  Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows.
12376	0.02743	Hey IE has the best virus interface in the world, so why shouldn't you welcome those little cute virus by sticking with the M$ IE?
12375	0.01013	Till there comes a time when FF come preinstall in PCs.... IE will continue to dominate. enuff said
12388	0.00574	IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
65125	0.18167	Chorme beats all its the fastest and the safest plus its also open source like firefox

12369	0.18373	Its an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than the average firefox user. <br/> sorry firefox losers... <br/> game <br/> set <br/> match <br/> go cry about IE somewhere else 8*^(
12381	0.00877	They say FF loads faster than IE, but 9 times out of 10, someone who had just installed FF will experience slower program load times than loading up IE.
12379	0.00713	firefox is so bloated now. It uses way more memory. Once everyone buys a new PC, and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to firefox. FireFox better get their act together. They are becoming more and more like Mozillia who got got gutted from a bloated Netscape. <br/> FireFox needs to get gutted. It shouldn't take all my system's memory to use a web browser.
12365	0.00847	(I am writing this through Firefox) Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool, Windows VirtualEarth.
12364	0.02432	I like those cute little popup windows. You don't get those with Firefox.
12389	0.00830	If you hover over IE7's tabs, the tooltip has the page title and address. <br/> Firefox 2.0 just has the title. <br/> Internet Explorer 7 has title and address.
71577	0.01002	Fire Fox doesn't allow some pop-ups on some websites like novanet. You need Internet explorer to install such websites
12380	0.00556	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues <br/> First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. <br/> Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. <br/> Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
12385	0.00690	IE is much easier to use. It also is more visually pleasing. It is much more secure as well.
12386	0.00932	I use Firefox, but the fact is not all sites work well with FireFox, so until its completely mainstream I gotta pick IE.
65191	0.02811	Well personally I believe Google Chrome is the S*** but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
71467	0.00962	Most of the government sites in India is designed only for IE, so it is important to have IE in your computer
