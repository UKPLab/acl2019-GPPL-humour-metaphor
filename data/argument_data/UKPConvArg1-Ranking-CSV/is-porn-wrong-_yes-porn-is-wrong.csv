Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which believe it or not, counts as cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
2473	0.18340	porn is wrong..... <br/> it's wrong 'cause it's not any good. <br/> if it were REALLY good, then it would REALLY be wrong.
2137504198	0.00600	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. <br/> Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.
71943	0.01933	well, the people who watch porn, <br/> i guess thats ok, its NORMAL. <br/> but the people who are <br/> IN the porn, that is not normal.. <br/> i read it in a abnormal psychology book, <br/> that means they have a disorder
54187	0.00651	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.
2471	0.01757	is it wrong? yes. unhealthy? yes. Addictive? yes. but so is smoking ciggarettes. just because its wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.

71555	0.00833	Biblically, yes it is wrong. But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
2472	0.10326	Adrian Peterson? Are you my husband, seriously? If not then I'm sorry. Your name, along with your speech, have me convinced you are. Good one BTW.
29393	0.00652	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... But it tends to screw up their reality.
1191878965	0.00846	hells yeah porn is wrong. i mean wtf. film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so jerk off's can jack off to them. porn is only here because it makes so much money and stupid people are buying into it. if it's not wrong then try watching it in front of your family, friends or the younger youth. yeah you would feel uncomfortable and you know why? because of common f**king sense and our conscience deep inside we know it's wrong.

29278	0.00635	Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
79734	0.14204	jarman: <br/> porn is wrong because it sholud be in 4-D with surround sound and special effects :) it would make it much more pleasurable btw im a girl........
81611	0.00875	I think it's wrong, It goes against women rights and those girls are under aged and abused. It's also really sick in a way, what freak would film people having sex?! I don't get it. I don't see what's so good about it, if you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
50112	0.14804	porn is wrong.............. unless it has smoken hot lesbians in it <br/> in fact i am downloading porn even as i type

39342	0.00704	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
79306	0.02223	I become suicidal thinking of the one i love most getting off on other women.
79609	0.00817	Even though humans have sexual desires, it doesn't mean people you don't even know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires to the one you love.
64199	0.00871	Is porn good for ur health ?No it isnot opponents say that porn doont have a serious effects on health. however studies have shown that porn and practice it can damage ur health slowly especially ur immune system . sooner or later thos who do porn in thier relationships definitely they donot have good health as others . here is a key question . somke is bad for u . somkers feel good when they smoke but smoke 100% leads to thier death and porn have the same influence on the health <br/> i think that smoke is better than porn in facr both of them are extremely bad for u
1607563438	0.01348	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, than hey who's to stop you! For the record, yeah it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's impossible to argue that, if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my first point.
2466	0.18738	Porn is Wrong. <br/> mainly because they are Not <br/> Doing it Right. <br/> it should be Hi Def. <br/> in three years, it will <br/> be in 3-D.
25796815	0.01772	What do you see in porn? <br/> -> sex <br/> What is sex for? <br/> -> baby making <br/> why should you watch others make baby? <br/> -> pleasure <br/> what causes pleasure? <br/> -> temptation <br/> what do you do to control temptation? <br/> -> then do it... <br/> conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is temptation to increase the population of the next generation... wow.
