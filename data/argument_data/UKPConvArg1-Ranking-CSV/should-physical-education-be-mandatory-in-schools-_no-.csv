arg244432	0.01759	if students so not have a physical education class then the obesity rate will go even higher than what it is now. that onw of the reason why also physical education reduce heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self dicipline, and also stress reduction.
arg216633	0.14119	I HATE P.E. I have to run so much and I hate it soooo much!!!!!
arg582041	0.01864	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
arg485419	0.02131	Sport should not be compulsaryy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> So man kids get bullied in pe because they are fatter then others or more unfit! Bullies pick there victims each day in pe so all u guys on the affirmative team are WRONG!
arg202606	0.01285	I'm in school and P.E. just make kids unhappy,a lot of people get sad because they are chosen last,they can't play for example I suck at P.E. class I hate I'm always the last to be chosen for the teams and it's not cool and it's not just obese kids there are many obese adults who did P.E. and didn't helped in anything
arg312577	0.01170	P.E. should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying.
arg263839	0.01194	No. PE has been around since more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
arg201958	0.08624	a PE teachers job must be really easy. they dont need to learn anything, all they have to do is yell at kids for an hour.
arg245105	0.01075	i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.
arg96567	0.11176	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
arg54267	0.01021	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. <br/> Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. <br/> Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.
arg96566	0.08755	it is simply too tiring. simply. so that is the reason why physical education should not be compulsory.The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
arg202607	0.18455	Besides just a few people apply physical exercises in their life's!
arg407143	0.01403	Core classes are more important. Kids should be more focused on learning, and the competitiveness can cause bullying.
arg625211	0.01391	Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
arg216634	0.02489	P.E doesn't help fat kids the fat kids just eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be normal.
arg351382	0.07913	Physical Ed causes many problems. Also, we shouldnt need Phys Ed to graduate school.
arg283063	0.01650	NO WAY! There are many people in my school who are fat and two periods of pe a week and afterschool sports has NOT changed any of them a tiny bit.
arg39274	0.01173	while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
arg110967	0.01035	phy. ed is just another class. students should start to be responsible for their actions by the time they are in highschool. if they are responsible with a car, then they should be responsible with their health. the tax payers also dont realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
arg337014	0.01267	Expensive, embarrassing for some, unfair for AP students that aren't in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
arg271353	0.01019	OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups
arg96565	0.04775	some children simply cannot take pe. 4 example some r already in athletics and they are alreaddy training like crazy
arg639971	0.01896	There are plenty of students who don't like Physical Education, so, it should be an elective subject.
arg203471	0.01361	Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
