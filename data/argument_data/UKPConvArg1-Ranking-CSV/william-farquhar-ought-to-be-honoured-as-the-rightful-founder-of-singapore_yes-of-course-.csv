arg168823	0.01019	Farquhar won the affection and respect from the people with his doings. When he was sacked, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
arg168808	0.10710	Crimes like robbing and fighting often occurred. Farquhar set up a small police force.
arg168776	0.01075	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
arg168806	0.02411	There were a lot of pests at that time, and the people were suffering from them. Raffles wasn't around, and William had to think of a solution himself.
arg168767	0.01738	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
arg168768	0.00917	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar so i believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
arg167722	0.13076	Farquhar did all the ground work to improve Singapore but Raffles only dreamt about what to do.
arg168780	0.00864	Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.
arg168774	0.01608	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.
arg168830	0.01801	Raffles came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
arg168793	0.10760	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper, but Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.
arg168766	0.01878	William Farquhar was sacked. Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions, so a lot of people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit them to Raffles
arg168804	0.00859	Faquhar solved the problems in Singapore using cash from his own pocket. When Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, Farquhar rewarded the people with coins for every pest they catch. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise.
arg168792	0.01081	Farquar dealt with every day problems during the early years of Singapore.He also attempted to know the people and understood malay, whereas Raffles hardly communicated with the people.
arg168786	0.02007	When Farquar was fired by Raffles, he was given a grander ceremony before he left compared to Raffles, which show how much the people loved him.
arg168818	0.00768	To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.
arg168805	0.01078	Farquar weeded out many problems, such as the rat and centipede infestation. It took only a few days for Farquar to finish destroying the infestation, whereas Raffles did not do anything about the problem at all.
arg168777	0.02272	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
arg168832	0.00892	The people recognized William Farquhar as the founder because he was there to deal with the country's problems when Raffles failed to be there for them. William Farquhar even took money out of his own pockets to resolve certain issues. When he was forced to leave, the people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts.
arg168831	0.03773	Even though Raffles did all the so-called planning, Farquhar did make some plans of his own, too, since Raffles had to leave for Bencoolen. This means that Farquhar had to plan on his own, too.
arg168801	0.00846	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
arg168779	0.12881	Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.
arg168834	0.00791	Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all. <br/> So what if he discovered the island majulah singapura, he did not help in the least in singapore's development. so why in the world should he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder'? <br/> Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
arg168764	0.01301	Farquhar was the one that played the role of a 'mother' to Singapore.He contributed more to Singapore than Raffles supporting the fact that he was the founder of Singapore.
arg168811	0.05231	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because Farquhar had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.
arg168822	0.00846	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other 'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.
arg168812	0.01763	Without William Farquhar Singapore would have perished. Only because William was there to govern the country, Singapore continued to exist. Raffles left to govern another country.
arg168807	0.04246	William Farquhar had helped more citizen of Singapore than Raffles did. Raffles was just more of the idea man. William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles.
arg168791	0.01013	There were pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests hurt some people. The rats also destroyed the food supplies. Tigers were also a threat to the people here. He solved it by giving rewards were given to those people who killed these pests.
arg168773	0.00927	William Farquhar stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so Farquhar had more time to get to know the people more, to earn the trust of the people, to find out the problems that the people were facing and to solve those problems
arg168783	0.02086	Farquhar ordered his men to go to Malacca and bring some food back. The traders in Singapore also brought some of the necessities here.
arg168825	0.01731	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
arg168770	0.04434	Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of ' being too close to the local population '. I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
arg168820	0.01318	William made the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learnt Malay just so to make conversation easier.
