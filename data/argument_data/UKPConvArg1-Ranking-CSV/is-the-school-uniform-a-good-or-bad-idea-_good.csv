arg203869	0.00462	I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. <br/> But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.
arg199079	0.01622	Wearing school uniform U can be sure that you go to school to study, not showing how fashionable you are
arg198417	0.00429	According to the legacy educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.
arg580102	0.32533	This is very. Bad as the uniforms are also cost effective
arg207727	0.00722	Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing. <br/> The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.
arg201071	0.00519	I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
arg580100	0.02537	it is good to follow to proper school code and the right to express emotions is right but not necessary as we have come school for learning
arg251981	0.01241	They prepare people for the clothes they may have to wear later on in life. They ensure that no unsuitable clothing is worn.
arg205860	0.32516	Who in their right mind wants to get rid of Catholic school girl outfits?
arg198325	0.00500	Student victimization is likely to be lowered and fights and gang activity should be decreased, as there is less competition in regard to wearing the most fashionable clothing.
arg299409	0.03854	Means you don't have to worry about what you hve to wear! <br/> Less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mufti...
arg198376	0.00463	That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
arg203922	0.00653	yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .
arg236393	0.01067	It is a good thing because this shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are or what religion they are.
arg205569	0.00513	School uniform is a great idea, just because it makes impossible to hold the race for the fashion among pupils. let it be, one pupil is richer than another. rich can begin to show off in front of those who are poorer. this action will create a negative atmosphere in the school and can start row between both pupils. As a rule, As a rule, it often occurs between the girls, although it is not rare between the boys. that's why school uniform liquidates all conflicts.
arg208793	0.00615	I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
arg561672	0.00481	1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms <br/> 2. Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to schools that don't have uniforms take like about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt I mean really?? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and
arg198890	0.00784	year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.
arg199548	0.01273	i think school uniform is really good idea!Yes i agree that a lot of pupils don't like it, but however it have a lot of benefits. As previous people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear!because it is very big problem for teenagers.
arg251866	0.00505	Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.
arg198256	0.00752	I believe that the school uniform is a good idea because school uniform improve student attendance and student doesn't spend a lot of time to choosing and buying clothes for school, espeacilly girls. That is why they can use more time to study.
arg198802	0.01022	it is good idea... children should be equal, and do not compare clothes of each other... if they see something new from their classmates, they want to buy it, even it is not necessary...
arg208794	0.00648	I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
arg234411	0.00501	In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . <br/> Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . <br/> So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .
arg252294	0.03643	Good idea for separate student from other people for at least increase garment job. Why we use soldier uniform? For separate from civil. Why terrorist not use soldier uniform? For harmonious with civil and easy to attack enemy.
arg212151	0.01482	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. <br/> Maybe I'm exaggerating. <br/> But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
arg234631	0.00518	i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.
arg200033	0.00557	I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.
arg200133	0.03769	school uniform does no harm to students life emotions now as for the point of expressing oneself imagine one bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes wont he look good.remember dressing sense also is a part of ur interveiw
arg198575	0.00497	i believe they are good! in this way all the girls out there would not tease each other about fashion issues and plus it makes all students look and feel equal which increases their attention on school work since they dont have to think if they are wearing the most expensive cloth is school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest and so..:D
arg198711	0.00679	I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
arg236207	0.00624	With uniforms there will be less of oh you dont wear this and you wear that. Then everyone is wearing the same thing and 1. it looks nicer 2. You dont have to spend forever trying to figure out what you are going to wear and 3. less drama, everyones wearing the same thing.
arg660921	0.00496	yas,of course . School uniform is important <br/> 1.school uniform is a logos for our school <br/> 2.to remind us that we are part of the school <br/> 3.and if we use the uniform basically student used to think what are they gonna do to, is it positive or negative <br/> 4.in the morning we should use our uniform and if were not use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student <br/> 5.if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that school <br/> thankyou
arg542561	0.00761	THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A VERY GOOOOOOOOOD IDEA , WHY ?? <br/> becouse the school uniform makes pupils concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe that school uniform instills discipline among pupils it makes pupils with diferent material statuses more equal :)
arg203291	0.00762	I think that such a policy is a good idea. Uniforms make students equal on an economic level This can be prevent envy and jealousy.
