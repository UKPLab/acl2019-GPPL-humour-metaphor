arg159445	0.00575	Books offer improvement with grammar and spelling skills. Plus it's more creative. With TV everything is done for you. With books you can imagine the characters looks and the setting with your own little creativity in it. <br/> Plus you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.

arg585714	0.00576	1. Books don't ruin your eyes like TV. does. <br/> 2. Books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. <br/> 3. Reading books a lot can help you with spelling. <br/> 4. Reading books a lot can help you write better. <br/> 5. Reading books teaches you to read. Watching TV. doesn't
arg135648	0.00835	One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles - I could go on and on. For real. There's very little that beats the world described in books.

arg135637	0.30476	TV is terrible. Except for Spongebob maybe. That's an alright show. Still, the majority of television is awful. So I'd have to say books based on that.
arg161579	0.03968	Books r like cool! TV is not! Books are for nerds, Tv is for weirdos, I think Black ops is better! ROFL!
arg223675	0.00580	I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. <br/> I am not completely against TV but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people <br/> http://www.echoworld.com/B05/B0510/B0510TVBad.htm

arg213296	0.00619	When you read a book you economize your money. I would like to mention that when you read a book, you do not need to buy any devices for reading and it is not necessary to use electricity.
arg213555	0.00575	Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain..?

arg273350	0.00674	Books are better than TV because books have each and every detail briefly . we get to read books like story books , fairy tales, ghost stories etc these books help us in bringing imaginary power in us . In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cant remember it easily but in books if we forget anything we can now and then read it .At last I only want to tell that books are much and much better than TV .
arg345719	0.01935	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have terrible arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it TV rots the brain.
arg663779	0.02732	books are better than TV because TV can make you blind. your eyes can also hurt alot if you watch to much.
arg135560	0.06120	books are always better than tv coz. books give more knowledge than tv does.
arg569496	0.00729	books are better than TV because most of the TV kids watch add influences to them which are not good and most parents don't care what there children watch and I thank book are better because you learn more from books.
arg135647	0.01155	Television is almost the exact same thing as books, the only difference is, you actually have to move your eyes for books
arg213294	0.01765	Well, Books is better than T.V. because T.V. makes you eyes bad is kills imagination dead! Read 'Television' by Roald Dhal you'll know it all!!! :) :) :) :)
