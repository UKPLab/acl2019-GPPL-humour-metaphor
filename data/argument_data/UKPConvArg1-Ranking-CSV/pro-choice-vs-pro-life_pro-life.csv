70668	0.00610	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. <br/> If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. <br/> Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
43483	0.02429	for everyone who is talking about RAPE in this subject let me ask you one thing!!!! if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? <br/> if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!
13275	0.00603	"The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever." <br/> The government DOES have that right. <br/> 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states <br/> 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body <br/> 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others <br/> 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal <br/> 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public <br/> there are many others. Men can also not do these things. <br/> The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
13276	0.01540	we did not create the baby, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.
13269	0.00732	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon position? <br/> If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, let's say for the sake of argument, a 5 gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?
59260	0.10424	when people condemned consensual-cannibalism in africa, did they think of these people's right to their bodies? no. why should abortion be any different?
30426	0.00827	if a woman gets raped and is left with the chil, she should put it up for adoption. if someone murders a pregnant women, they get charged for killing the woman and the fetus. People have the stupid excuss that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. if you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.
13263	0.10988	Not to be glib, but are you stating that we should look to the government to assist us with our belief system. <br/> Ever read T. Hobbes...?
28923	0.00644	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the baby and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power to chose and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
13268	0.00945	I argue for the rights of the child, who deserves the same right to life as the mother
54474	0.00587	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?
13277	0.05140	the one whom bestows life, is the one whom bestows death
76937	0.01755	I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
13300	0.00681	I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.
34503	0.01515	having some choices are good. but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. i have always been pro life. and yes i do believe abortions should be illegal.
13264	0.00986	Don't kid yourself: the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
13260	0.00553	There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. <br/> And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.
80248	0.01580	I am Pro-Life, <br/> Here is a question for anyone who is Pro-Choice: Is the baby in the mother's stomach living and if not how do you know?
13259	0.00776	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid off moves away at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours, since it feels outside your own.
13280	0.01015	i do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. Murder....is murder
75146	0.01322	what we are dealing with is indirect murder if a women decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society
1148434436	0.10319	What i dont undertsand is how people rationalize taking life it just doesnt make any sense... idc the situation in america how is killing leagal?
75040	0.09130	My one question... <br/> Why is it we argue for the "right" to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
13279	0.11836	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
33181	0.00675	One word: Adoption <br/> There is absolutley no reason to receive an abortion when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. <br/> This is a commonly ignored fact in the abortion debate. But I think it is by far the best choice.
13270	0.00611	"If a women is raped" is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
34485	0.00994	there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. <br/> if the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
13267	0.01017	You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument. The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. <br/> In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and vary your sources rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that fit your point of view.
30319	0.00553	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
13303	0.00726	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. <br/> Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
13257	0.00650	Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies <br/> It's illegal to commit suicide <br/> If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute <br/> So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body
59722	0.08645	Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!
54558	0.00680	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! When rape occurs why is it the poor, defenceless baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child? <br/> Women have become selfish where there bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about
13256	0.06691	I choose life <br/> Reagan once said something like this <br/> Notice that everyone who is pro choice has been born
13258	0.01819	That situation is very rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault
