74812	0.00582	NO. I am a female who watches porn. <br/> It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. <br/> I think its natural for people to have sexual desires. <br/> If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it. <br/> But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.
1624453916	0.01295	Porn is not wrong. If it is really wrong, then Porn should be "Illegal". Porn supplies the "Erotic" needs of people who doesn't have a partner. :)
49684	0.01016	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for exploitation.
37291	0.21573	whatever ? <br/> porn is a f**king way of life ? <br/> i bet yous any money that all the people on the yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins :L
13988	0.00638	Everyone has their own desires, and sure women are degraded by pornography but it's their choice to choose that career path. If they want to be in that business, it's their choice.
58869	0.01203	porn is not wrong unless its sick porn eg child,animal or rape but the other pornography is ok aslong as its viewed in a discreet manner.
73596	0.00577	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
13994	0.00561	Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
13993	0.14867	No porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
14009	0.00558	Is porn wrong? Absolutley not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it then don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether your the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.
37292	0.22301	hmm, yess there either all virgins or still live at home with there mothers and cant have porn LOL
38908	0.15283	i LIKE porn, jerking off is always a good time
13991	0.02268	I also find it telling that there's (as of now) seven votes for "Porn is wrong", but no one is willing (able?) to say why.
61111	0.01244	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it isn't wrong it's genius
13990	0.00797	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. <br/> As if there's no such thing as porn *actors*. (What, men don't count?) <br/> Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "Feminist" bullsh*t.
37675	0.00526	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like it? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? Nope. If you do not like porn, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
14003	0.00484	Easy access to porn may be the reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years, according to a law professor at Northwestern University.
14002	0.00500	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. <br/> Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. <br/> It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
36698	0.02649	No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is wrong but really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex how would we have babies.
32997	0.00917	Listen porn is not wrong because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Porn not only teaches but also gives prime examples.
54763	0.00555	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It really can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice.It really is just as simple as that.
14007	0.01377	Porn isn't wrong, as long as you aren't doing it behind your partner's back. <br/> It's only degrading to the women who choose to pose.
13986	0.00571	All humans have sexual desires. Sometimes, one just isn't in the mood for sex, and would like simple release. Pornography facilitates this.
14004	0.00552	Porn kills nobody. It's a profitable source of entertainment for some. <br/> Can somebody really tell me what's wrong with it without injecting their moral standards into the argument?
13997	0.01049	I don't feel degraded by porn. You don't like it? Don't watch it. There are more importhant jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
13989	0.00895	The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? Look at Europe- they're cool with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
14000	0.00542	Porn is anything but wrong in most cases. Sometimes it's in very bad taste, but when it's giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there's nothing wrong, and I could even consider it an art form in some respects.
13998	0.00549	me and my wife share an exciting and passionate love life. we love the porn. we pop it on and use it to kick it up a notch. set the room on fire. for us itt is a way to share and expand the love we enjoy together in the bedroom. <br/> so as long as it is legal and everyone is of age then there should be no problem.
13987	0.02458	Yeah, women are degraded by pornography, but if it's already done, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it :P
35341	0.00719	it is not wrong, and if your talking about the actors doing the scene its theyre choice..they like doing it and its not degrading to women they wanna do it. we have freedom of expression you know. and it also helps some of us to be open about sex
69927	0.00893	Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
