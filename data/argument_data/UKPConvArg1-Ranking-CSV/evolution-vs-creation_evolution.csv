80854	0.00577	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. <br/> The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.
778	0.01173	Life has been around for billions of years. Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying. :)
800	0.00592	Peppered moths is the ULTIMATE straw man. <br/> The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. <br/> There is loads of evidence to support evolution. <br/> Genes <br/> Fossil record <br/> Carbon dating <br/> Geological data <br/> VIRUS studies <br/> Ohh yeah, viruses. <br/> Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. <br/> Your flu injections are made using evolution science.
790	0.01936	How can that be? How were you brought up? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night? <br/> I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). <br/> So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.
58082	0.00701	I like to think both are true. <br/> 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) <br/> 2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) <br/> I believe in God and Evolution.
806	0.11689	sabrejimmy, <br/> I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. <br/> Not once did i say that we are still evolving. <br/> I have not made any such assertions. <br/> So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. <br/> So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. <br/> And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. <br/> It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
62156	0.05362	I just don't see why it matters so much. We're here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary. <br/> Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.
809	0.01482	If you can, then please do so. Illuminate us with your facts! <br/> Do you have brain scans of the first humans? How about average organ sizes? Hair patterns? Facial characteristics? Heart rate records? <br/> Speaking of these factors, how do you sabrejimmy account for the different racial characteristics of modern humans? I'm married to a Japanese woman. Why do we look so different? <br/> Was there in fact an Asian Garden of Eden? And an African Garden of Eden? And a ... <br/> What do you actually believe anyhow?
820	0.00657	Actually, we are evolving. Look this one up; every generation our small toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we'll end up losing it. <br/> I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it is evolution at work.
74907	0.00802	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
785	0.10815	There is not God. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments. Sorry.
798	0.10788	Just a note to the creationists. Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly. <br/> You're supposed to click this if the person's argument convinced you that Creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right hand side. <br/> This will not help you win the debate by the way.
770	0.00737	Define "order and detail." Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," and equally well written.
804	0.14247	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a load of crap. <br/> This is what makes these kinds of debates pointless. You have some idiot creationists, who don't understand anything about science. <br/> sabrejimmy hasn't attempted to learn anything from this debate. He continues to ask ridiculous questions. <br/> Personally, I think I will have to ignore his future posts. Intelligent debate is satisfying, but this isn't.
74767	0.00641	There's no concrete evidence that supports that god exists. <br/> Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes that I become less and less convinced in his existence... <br/> Evolution makes more sense to me. <br/> Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve <br/> to be able to survive through different climates and situations.
814	0.00637	Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
578317615	0.00575	I call the god that creationists believe in the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited. People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.
79918	0.00842	its simple, how would we be able to adapt to different enviroments. Over time we adapted to what suited us best otherwise why arn't we one skin colour, why are there so many types of animals
813	0.00790	think about it, it's impossible for evolution to NOT happen. the weak die, the strong continue to breed. this strengthens the species. argument over. <br/> however, creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. i don't believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing
29310	0.04065	all i have to say on this issue is that there is actual evidence to support evolution!!
43519	0.01098	There is no argument need to be made. <br/> The entire scientific community agrees: Evolution happened and is still happening.
789	0.12131	Really? What if I my opponent has ACTUALLY been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth? Would that make your arguments any weaker?
821	0.04875	You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism <br/> --- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)
823	0.01192	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen. <br/> Who says that God did it himself? <br/> Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur? <br/> FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION
794	0.00576	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution
72483	0.01305	Why is this up for debate? I understand that people have religious beliefs and stuff, and thats fine by me people should be able to do what they without being judged on every move they make, but it's scientifically proven that the evolution is correct. What's your point?
817	0.00610	Radiometric dating can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. It is the fact they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes it scientific rigor. I would recommend going tohttp://www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.
801	0.00649	"So why don't we have talking monkeys?" <br/> That's a red herring. <br/> Monkeys haven't evolved to talk(by talk im guessing you mean speech) because they are incapable of speech. <br/> We on the other hand have evolved to talk. <br/> Yes if we are descended from monkeys that doesn't stop monkeys from existing. We are a BRANCH on the tree of life. Not a dead end.
788	0.00734	Evolution does occur and it has been documented, and studied. i invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html <br/> and give you your thoughts. thanks
802	0.01947	"How come people aren't still evolving?" <br/> How are you so sure we are not? <br/> Could you please show some evidence that we are NOT evolving? And dont say, because we would notice if we were. <br/> Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.
824	0.01160	Were we magically created in a few days or an outcome which was processed throughout billions of years? <br/> Which is more realistic? <br/> Which was more likely to happen?
803	0.00734	I have to contradict phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur. <br/> When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
780	0.01049	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? <br/> Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." <br/> Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
822	0.02041	Not it's not. But along your line of argument, believe in "Creationism" and "God" is like believing that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he? <br/> You clearly don't understand evolution. Read a book or two.
816	0.00790	This is this common view of the creationist argument. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world. . This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, just dont try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology. It is about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down. http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/ganderson/es10/lectures/lecture01/sci.method.jpg
