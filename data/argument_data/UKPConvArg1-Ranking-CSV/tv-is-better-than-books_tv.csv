arg479199	0.00453	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also likely to be not updated with latest information about a certain topic while information from TV can be much more accurate and useful.
arg585676	0.00702	Television uses electricity and books such as harry potter are made of trees so it causes more damage to the environment.
arg585674	0.00439	A picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama and Missouri vs. seeing them and seeing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. <br/> Books take too much time. TV gives the info much faster.

arg399270	0.00477	Without TV actors/actresses wouldn't have jobs. <br/> Without TV you wouldn't know what's happening around the world. I mean the newspapers can't fit all that in. <br/> Books and newspapers can't give you emergency warnings or updates or new flashes

arg470033	0.00429	I think T.V. is more helpful as the you can watch and listen to something being explained like if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful. As concerning the time limit or harm to our eyes, we should watch T.V. in a limit, because the excess of everything is harmful, even reading of books. <br/> Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he had read and 50% of what he had listened and watched.

arg618914	0.00514	Unless the brain is used no human being can understand any medium. Be it TV or books. By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Even viewing tv requires brains. And moreover we can watch television in the dark. But to read a book you need the lights on. Which also wastes electricity.

arg243908	0.00484	People who are against tv keep on saying that it causes obesity. <br/> I'm not going to go for a run and bring a book to read on the way. I think it is much easier to exercise watching tv then reading a book. <br/> In gyms people do not have books infront of them, instead they have telvisions. <br/> Studies have shown that telivision is even more stimulating than books.
