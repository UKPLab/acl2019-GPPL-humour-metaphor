arg246334	0.41194	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways.

arg229388	0.11432	I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) <br/> I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. <br/> It allows for more logic in my mind.

arg244579	0.35088	Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.	A6N8R8JFVE2YK

arg246334	0.06179	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. <br/> With Athe√Øsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.	A1EU25HIF6NX3E

arg229388	0.50000	I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) <br/> I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. <br/> It allows for more logic in my mind.
