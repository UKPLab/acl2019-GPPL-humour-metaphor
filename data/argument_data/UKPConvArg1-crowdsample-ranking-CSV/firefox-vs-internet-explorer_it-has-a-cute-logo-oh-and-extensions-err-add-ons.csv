31493	0.03388	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! <br/> Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/ <br/> OH AND. <br/> Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.	A2V0X1GBDHVZL3

469	0.17544	Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. <br/> If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? <br/> It's not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.
