If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient.

arg199548	0.64912	i think school uniform is really good idea!Yes i agree that a lot of pupils don't like it, but however it have a lot of benefits. As previous people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear!because it is very big problem for teenagers.	A3Q2YIMBH7BN99
arg234631	0.50000	i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.

arg561672	0.50000	1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms <br/> 2. Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to schools that don't have uniforms take like about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt I mean really?? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and	A2CT57W84KXX25

arg198711	0.17544	I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.	A2WS2N6YRHWUO7
arg236393	0.32456	It is a good thing because this shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are or what religion they are.	A2WS2N6YRHWUO7
arg234411	0.17544	In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . <br/> Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . <br/> So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .

arg199079	0.32456	Wearing school uniform U can be sure that you go to school to study, not showing how fashionable you are	A2WS2N6YRHWUO7
arg205569	0.50000	School uniform is a great idea, just because it makes impossible to hold the race for the fashion among pupils. let it be, one pupil is richer than another. rich can begin to show off in front of those who are poorer. this action will create a negative atmosphere in the school and can start row between both pupils. As a rule, As a rule, it often occurs between the girls, although it is not rare between the boys. that's why school uniform liquidates all conflicts.	A10L6JFWPRXEKM
arg251866	0.50000	Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.

arg207727	0.17544	Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing. <br/> The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.	A128MTXKG7K652

arg200033	0.32456	I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.	A128MTXKG7K652
