arg244440	0.17544	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes.

arg244447	0.11866	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end.

arg636360	0.35088	One of the key component to Christianity is FAITH. Just you because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith to Christians is the same way.	A1M1R84Q73QBW
arg229317	0.64912	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.	A1M1R84Q73QBW

Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. <br/> But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. <br/> Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?

arg244440	0.02920	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be. <br/> Although I'm religious person, I think atheist can stand to hear besause everyone is indepent and everyone has to have his own opinion.
