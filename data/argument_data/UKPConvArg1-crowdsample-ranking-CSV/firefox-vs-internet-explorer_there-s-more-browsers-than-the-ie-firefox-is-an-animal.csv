12380	0.17544	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues <br/> First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. <br/> Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. <br/> Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

12379	0.35088	firefox is so bloated now. It uses way more memory. Once everyone buys a new PC, and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to firefox. FireFox better get their act together. They are becoming more and more like Mozillia who got got gutted from a bloated Netscape. <br/> FireFox needs to get gutted. It shouldn't take all my system's memory to use a web browser.

12371	0.01225	I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. <br/> So I think IE is better than firefox.	A14SICTOVWQNE8
