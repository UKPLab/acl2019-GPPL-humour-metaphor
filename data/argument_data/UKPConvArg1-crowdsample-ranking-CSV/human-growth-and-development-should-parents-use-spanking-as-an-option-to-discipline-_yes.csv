arg335090	0.11696	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.	A14KV0QGAVOMD
arg335034	0.21637	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.	A14KV0QGAVOMD
arg334923	0.11696	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	A14KV0QGAVOMD
arg334922	0.21637	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.	A14KV0QGAVOMD
arg335092	0.11696	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.	A14KV0QGAVOMD
arg335134	0.21637	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works	A14KV0QGAVOMD
arg334967	0.06179	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.	A1YVUKSA7LZP0
arg334938	0.11432	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	A1YVUKSA7LZP0
arg334932	0.41194	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.	A1YVUKSA7LZP0
arg335285	0.41194	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort	A1YVUKSA7LZP0

arg336222	0.41194	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)	A32TJVALAWJXZA

arg334886	0.07547	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.	ANI9GSEQ5SPWA

arg334898	0.07547	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.	ANI9GSEQ5SPWA
arg335054	0.07547	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.	ANI9GSEQ5SPWA

arg334964	0.50000	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.	A1PMKPD5QEU891
arg335047	0.35026	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.	AJ2KN5F0ZH8U3

arg334884	0.01956	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	A29H76PRANC3J7
