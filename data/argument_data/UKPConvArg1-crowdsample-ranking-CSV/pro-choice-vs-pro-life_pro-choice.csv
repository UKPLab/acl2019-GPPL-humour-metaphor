1633	0.35088	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.	A1ZXXCUFJBA93V
1640	0.64912	people can make the choice for themselves. it is not up to us or the government to decide to add more unwanted children to this world.	A1ZXXCUFJBA93V
1654	0.02764	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.	A18QTARQHC83F2
1644	0.26890	your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. <br/> You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.	A18QTARQHC83F2
1674	0.02764	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?	A18QTARQHC83F2

1641	0.25620	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.

1665	0.35088	I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know: <br/> if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion? <br/> i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side	A3TDIHNXMV9YBQ

63512	0.35088	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	A2QVGEF11016BW

Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost.

One of those lives actually knew what life was.	A1YIBA1KYF80UD

63512	0.01616	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost.

To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) <br/> You must be human (homosapien) <br/> You must be able to contribute to society. <br/> By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.

73708	0.02302	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.	A29H76PRANC3J7

1636	0.02302	I am personally against the abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother what I think or what most of the people thinks about it. She must decide what to do with her child.	A29H76PRANC3J7
1634	0.04259	It really depends the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.	A29H76PRANC3J7
28498	0.02302	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. <br/> And I know many children get adopted but many don't <br/> and it might be better off to just have an abortion to <br/> let them suffer. <br/> That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to <br/> decide one womans pregnancy.	A29H76PRANC3J7
1635	0.03280	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.	A29H76PRANC3J7
63512	0.04511	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	A29H76PRANC3J7
1700	0.04219	Sorry, one more thing: <br/> I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against. <br/> If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.	A29H76PRANC3J7

1674	0.15346	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?	A29H76PRANC3J7
1637	0.15346	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. <br/> Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?

74766	0.02302	The right to abortion should not be abused, <br/> however I do believe that the choice should be provided. <br/> NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.	A29H76PRANC3J7

Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.	A29H76PRANC3J7

1654	0.03280	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government.

37929	0.02302	Im going to take the Obama approach to this <br/> Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it	A29H76PRANC3J7
1639	0.04259	It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of "who decides"? <br/> A woman is not your property. Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude.	A29H76PRANC3J7
1661	0.08131	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.	A29H76PRANC3J7

58594	0.32456	It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.	AQIU1TGWM9YMX

28841	0.64912	a common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?" <br/> there is a simple counter to this: <br/> what if this person who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
