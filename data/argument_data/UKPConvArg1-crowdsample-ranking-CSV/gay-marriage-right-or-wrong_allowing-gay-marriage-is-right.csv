Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.	A13CBHSP2558HR

Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.	A2AYYBCUJDPLJF

76758	0.17544	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way. 3	A33VT6UJMHE9P2

You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them.

560	0.04504	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them.

Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. <br/> And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change.

Different people have different point of views.We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions.

I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. <br/> Life is what you want it to be	A2P1AJXPHCLLMY

What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.	A1FL20WGFRJS1T
76758	0.50000	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way. 3	A1FL20WGFRJS1T
