arg33105	0.17544	it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.

arg33158	0.32456	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg33086	0.17544	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg33128	0.32456	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg33115	0.08751	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33159	0.08751	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33091	0.01313	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33101	0.09309	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33167	0.12771	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33157	0.06741	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33142	0.06741	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33165	0.08751	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33146	0.08751	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33127	0.16189	I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33173	0.08193	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	A18QTARQHC83F2

arg33126	0.35088	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.	A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ

For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.	A3NKA5KYYMG44F

arg33173	0.12982	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	A3NKA5KYYMG44F
arg33111	0.07018	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve.

arg33053	0.50000	In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a break down or something.	A2QFSX7BWT3BQ3
arg33057	0.50000	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	A2QFSX7BWT3BQ3
arg33126	0.11696	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person.

Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve.

Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	ANI9GSEQ5SPWA
arg33057	0.04570	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	ANI9GSEQ5SPWA
arg33111	0.08454	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve.

If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.	A2B349764XVZX0

arg33128	0.16228	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.	A2B349764XVZX0
arg33115	0.35088	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.	A3SFB9SWZOJ7Z0
arg33073	0.64912	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.	A3SFB9SWZOJ7Z0
