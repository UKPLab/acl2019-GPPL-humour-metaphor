arg35714	0.05254	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg35638	0.09720	I rather have a lousy father then not have a father at all. Having a lousy father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if he's lousy you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg35732	0.35026	I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg35619	0.35026	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. <br/> So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way) <br/> Also, people change. Who says that he will be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg35720	0.05254	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.	A2I5HGFRL5GVQJ
arg35609	0.09720	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you.

arg35747	0.08170	I feel like it's better to have a lousy father than to not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, it means that there's always a possibility that one day they may be good at it. To be fatherless, there's not even a chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father would be better.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg35623	0.08170	I believe its better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless. I myself know what's its like to not have a father, so to me it would be better to have a lousy father than no father at all. For some people, to have a lousy father is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you really have it until he is gone and never coming back.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg35643	0.10607	A lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family.

arg35655	0.10607	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg35584	0.10607	It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.

arg35697	0.64912	I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him.

arg35676	0.05148	I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.	A2DVDYE2SXT0BB

A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.	AQ8BWB7RNSQ6A

Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life.

A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life.

As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.	A37CPJIB3XKUI3

And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.	A37CPJIB3XKUI3
arg35697	0.41194	I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him.

A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.	A4TIA0LJ3Z5WP

The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.	A4TIA0LJ3Z5WP

arg35714	0.13245	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.	A3C3TQ8GNXO972

He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys.
