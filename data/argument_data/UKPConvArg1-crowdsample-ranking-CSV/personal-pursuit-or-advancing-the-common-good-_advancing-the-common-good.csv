arg33103	0.20597	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33136	0.20597	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33139	0.03090	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33133	0.05716	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33178	0.20597	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33135	0.20597	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33075	0.03090	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.	A18QTARQHC83F2
arg33155	0.05716	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves.

arg33114	0.11696	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.	A2J4A3FM82SHCB
arg33119	0.21637	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	A2J4A3FM82SHCB
arg33084	0.11696	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	A2J4A3FM82SHCB

arg33089	0.21637	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.	A2J4A3FM82SHCB

arg33047	0.17544	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.	A3E2PM1UCTXHMY

arg33134	0.32456	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	ALSMSDQNVZ6IZ
arg33156	0.35088	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life.

I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse.

arg33113	0.32456	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time.

arg33135	0.06179	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	A1SPVT0LRQWIYH

arg33178	0.04772	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.

arg33129	0.17544	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself.
