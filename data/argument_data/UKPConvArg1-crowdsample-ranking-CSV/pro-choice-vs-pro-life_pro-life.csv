So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women.

30426	0.21637	if a woman gets raped and is left with the chil, she should put it up for adoption. if someone murders a pregnant women, they get charged for killing the woman and the fetus. People have the stupid excuss that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. if you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.	A2B349764XVZX0

Men can also not do these things. <br/> The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.	A2B349764XVZX0

If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.	A2B349764XVZX0
