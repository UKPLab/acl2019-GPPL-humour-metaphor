They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	A3AXZX0LSNB5X4

arg334968	0.12088	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.	A265XKF8DSIKDL
arg336204	0.35088	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	A3PMMH94T6YR5F
arg334960	0.64912	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.	A3PMMH94T6YR5F

arg336029	0.11432	does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody then you get hit. you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the saame person	A3QGFLKL2G6NJJ
arg334929	0.11696	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.	A1YVUKSA7LZP0

arg335564	0.11696	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them	A1YVUKSA7LZP0

arg336204	0.11696	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	A1YVUKSA7LZP0
