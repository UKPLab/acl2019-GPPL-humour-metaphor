arg33300	0.21854	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love.

Murder Is a heavy offense <br/> But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person <br/> You're marrying into the Family.

If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.	A7OWP0PQ1EI0A
arg33259	0.64912	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)	A7OWP0PQ1EI0A
arg33302	0.10626	I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33328	0.10542	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33237	0.00732	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33265	0.00732	No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership. <br/> Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police <br/> A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,' <br/> I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense <br/> But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person <br/> You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY?? <br/> If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)	A29H76PRANC3J7

arg33358	0.07123	No way, <br/> That's even better than a prenup :) <br/> her: "I'm leaving you and taking half your shit." <br/> me: "Hope you like prison b*^#h"	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33288	0.00732	As human beings, we are selfish and have been fabricated with a survival mechanism that tell is to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33320	0.00732	I dont believe i would turn them in because of love.But i certainly would not stay with her; i would move away from her as far as i could.For the simple reason i wouldnt want to be involed with the crime, because i knew about it.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33333	0.03301	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. <br/> Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33319	0.02135	I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.	A29H76PRANC3J7

arg33343	0.00732	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33296	0.04880	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.

arg33255	0.00732	Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33353	0.02291	No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33354	0.00888	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.

arg33341	0.00732	If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33257	0.08944	Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33300	0.04533	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33233	0.01784	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33270	0.01238	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33298	0.04533	If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.	A29H76PRANC3J7
arg33242	0.09764	More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in.	A29H76PRANC3J7
