In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich .

Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .

Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing. The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.

arg203922_arg212151	A1HF57KXRQJYIG	a1	yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. Maybe I'm exaggerating. But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.

So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .

arg198256_arg212151	AGNY9AWGBNBOU	a1	I believe that the school uniform is a good idea because school uniform improve student attendance and student doesn't spend a lot of time to choosing and buying clothes for school, espeacilly girls. That is why they can use more time to study.	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. Maybe I'm exaggerating. But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.

arg201071_arg198890	A12SRI7R4HQIVN	a1	I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.	year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear .
