You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them.

Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." There's a loving god, eh?

Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change.

I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.

The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." There's a loving god, eh?
560_76758	A2HO6I23V0847M	a2	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice.

Different people have different point of views.We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.

Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...

Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." There's a loving god, eh?

This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?

Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids?

Religion, lifestyle etc is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions or cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.

Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids?

I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets.

I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.

If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions or cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.

It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... but only because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned. Also it was seen to weaken the position of men.

Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.

Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.

I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level.

EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards!

Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like !!	one reason is just because so many more people agree with this side now

I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...

Third of all, the government would have a better image if we allow the third gender to have the equal right of marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.

EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roomates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits.Civil Unions, gone, Gay marraige, IN!

Who are you to tell people that their veiws are incorrect and that they must change there feelings and that apparently they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.
