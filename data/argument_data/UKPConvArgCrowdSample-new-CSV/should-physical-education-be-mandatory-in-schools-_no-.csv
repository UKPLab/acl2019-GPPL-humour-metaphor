You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?	Physical Ed causes many problems. Also, we shouldnt need Phys Ed to graduate school.

arg271353_arg202607	A28UC2SDFHU3SV	a1	OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups	Besides just a few people apply physical exercises in their life's!
