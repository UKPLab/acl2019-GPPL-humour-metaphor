Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates.

To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) You must be human (homosapien) You must be able to contribute to society. By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. And I know many children get adopted but many don't and it might be better off to just have an abortion to let them suffer. That's the chance they take, I guess.
