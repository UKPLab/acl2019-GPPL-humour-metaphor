I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there's no such thing as porn *actors*. (What, men don't count?) Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "Feminist" bullsh*t.

If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.

Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)

No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is wrong but really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex how would we have babies.
