Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)

Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/ OH AND. Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.

I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS.
