I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them.

I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy.

I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.

I Believe that its better to have a lously father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at.

Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.

Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life.

Fathers can sometimes be lousy, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them.

I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy they are still our kin.	It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.

Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy they are still our kin.

Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
arg35642_arg35714	A21O9NP8KW1L7U	a2	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesnt think I need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
