If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.

Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.

A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would turn my spouse in.
arg33332_arg33221	A265XKF8DSIKDL	a2	I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend?

I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?

After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught.

A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger.

I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind.

If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in.

If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.

I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger.

It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.
