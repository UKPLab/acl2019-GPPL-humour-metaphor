Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. - Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.	I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. It allows for more logic in my mind.

I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.

Notmymuse, Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
