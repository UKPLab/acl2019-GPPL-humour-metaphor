If being homosexual was natural then 1.

An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.

Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks.

Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok.

"Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem. " What is 'gay sex'?

But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.

Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it.

Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing.

Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.

Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.

We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
