So yeah im not to sure	If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.
arg33252_arg33328	A3SNCAAITY722U	a2	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again.

Murder Is a heavy offense But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??

arg33233_arg33328	A3LWAR1QNK5ECW	a1	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would.

All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in!

Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would done. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone.

No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word.

arg33354_arg33298	A29VPPMRUBZ7II	a2	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.

But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know? ;)
