The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions.

So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions.

I call the god that creationists believe in the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.

So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.

People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.	Evolution does occur and it has been documented, and studied. i invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and give you your thoughts. thanks
800_802	A2QFSX7BWT3BQ3	a1	Peppered moths is the ULTIMATE straw man. The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.	"How come people aren't still evolving?" How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are NOT evolving? And dont say, because we would notice if we were. Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.

Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving.
