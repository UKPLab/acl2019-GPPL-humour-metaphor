But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.	physical education should be mandatory cuhz 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 so far and it's because of the lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese!!!!

In my opinion I think that it should be obligatory to have PE classes in schools because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes would be obligatory there would be much less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
