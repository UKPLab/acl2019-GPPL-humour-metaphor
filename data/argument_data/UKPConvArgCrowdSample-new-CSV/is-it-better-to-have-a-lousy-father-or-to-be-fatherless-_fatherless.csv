arg35632_arg35604	A95EGIB3Y0SU8	a1	It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been.

I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.

I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
arg35713_arg35604	AT3ZLI3K2MGWA	a1	I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like . My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment.

arg35686_arg35604	AXL8STMTF8Z21	a1	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.

I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him?

I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
arg35673_arg35604	A27M49WVNHP3JL	a1	In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.

I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.

Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me.

I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.

It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
arg35718_arg35604	AP9PF7U3KHBEK	a1	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.

A father is someone is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.
arg35639_arg35604	A211JD5XCF6IZR	equal	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence.

A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life.

Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one.

So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.

Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper.

A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything.

If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.

Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father.

Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.

The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion).

Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
