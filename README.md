> **Abstract:** The inability to quantify key aspects of creative
> language is a frequent obstacle to natural language understanding.
> To address this, we introduce novel tasks for evaluating the
> creativeness of language—namely, scoring and ranking text by
> humorousness and metaphor novelty.  To sidestep the difficulty of
> assigning discrete labels or numeric scores, we learn from pairwise
> comparisons between texts.  We introduce a Bayesian approach for
> predicting humorousness and metaphor novelty using Gaussian process
> preference learning (GPPL), which achieves a Spearman's ρ of 0.56
> against gold using word embeddings and linguistic features.  Our
> experiments show that given sparse, crowdsourced annotation data,
> ranking using GPPL outperforms best–worst scaling. We release a new
> dataset for evaluating humour containing 28,210 pairwise comparisons
> of 4030 texts, and make our software freely available.
