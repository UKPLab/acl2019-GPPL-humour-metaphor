         1 27 Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.


         -3 30 Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!


         0 -27 I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.


         -1 -28 I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.


         -2 29 Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.


         -5 -32 Firefox of course. And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com


         -3 30 I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.


         -2 29 I learned English through TV. <br/> Technically, I learned English through interaction with native speakers, but TV helped a lot more than books.


         3 31 i think there is no doubt on this that India has power to lead the world.


         0 28 Right Now, In My opinion to be fatherless. Trust me I Went through it. Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.


         4 32 It Improves academic skills of a child .Television has made children enthusiastic and confident. <br/> Children improve their academics and increase their ideas and innovations!!!


         0 28 Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.


         1 30 Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?


         1 30 William made the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learnt Malay just so to make conversation easier.


         -2 32 yas,of course . School uniform is important <br/> 1.school uniform is a logos for our school <br/> 2.to remind us that we are part of the school <br/> 3.and if we use the uniform basically student used to think what are they gonna do to, is it positive or negative <br/> 4.in the morning we should use our uniform and if were not use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student <br/> 5.if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that school <br/> thankyou


         1 31 its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.


         0 31 No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.


         1 32 I think that school uniform is a bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and its a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the mmorning


         0 32 As a young boy you grow hoping and that they have a father figure in there life to be there when he is needed. The last thing they need is someone who lives with you and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man it is important that you have someone in your life to support you and push you to be successful in life.


         -1 33 It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child

         -21 0 It would be better to have a lousy father than to not a have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.


         23 -3 because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.


         24 4 What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? <br/> Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." <br/> Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.


         23 4 I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.


         -21 -2 Id rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. Having a lousy father who tires to tell me what to but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. Id rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to make money to put food on the table.


         -22 -4 No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.


         23 -6 I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.


         -21 4 I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.


         -20 -3 I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.


         -17 0 I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.


         22 6 India does have ptential to lead the world, but so does China! America continues to outsource good manufactoring jobs to these countries resulting in an economic boost for India and China!


         20 -4 Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.


         -17 1 William Farquhar was sacked. Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions, so a lot of people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit them to Raffles


         -19 3 I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.


         20 4 I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!


         24 9 I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.


         25 10 I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.


         -16 1 I like to think both are true. <br/> 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) <br/> 2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) <br/> I believe in God and Evolution.


         17 -2 aah...u r saying like that only india has this things.....other countries donot have this.....does the america which seems as leading the world doesnt have bad qualities.....it eats less and waste more.....the amount of food they waste can be utillised for feeding whole indian population...it produces more pollution and blame us...what about it !!!!!!!


         -17 -3 Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted. Needless to say they should have let her.

         22 0 India does have ptential to lead the world, but so does China! America continues to outsource good manufactoring jobs to these countries resulting in an economic boost for India and China!


         22 0 I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.


         -22 0 No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.


         23 0 I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.

Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.


         -23 0 I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.


         -23 0 A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.


         23 0 because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.


         24 0 FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"


         24 0 I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.


         24 0 William Farquhar stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so Farquhar had more time to get to know the people more, to earn the trust of the people, to find out the problems that the people were facing and to solve those problems


         24 0 What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? <br/> Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." <br/> Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.

So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.


         25 0 I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.


         26 0 A women and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why is that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty? <br/> Jon Jax 71


         29 0 I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.


         30 0 You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.
