List of experiments to include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Performance, computation time, memory vs no. inducing points
\item Performance, computation time, memory vs update size
\item Performance, computation time vs different initialisation methods for the inducing points; include different initialisations of K-means
\end{enumerate}
